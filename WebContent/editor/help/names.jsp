	Names
	</p>
	<p>
	When you create a character profile, you must provide a value for at least 
	one of the name fields. 
	</p>
	<p>
	You should provide values for as many of the fields as you can, even if you don't 
	think there will be a need for a prefix or a suffix, for example.  
	</p>
	<p>
	You may decide later to use the character in a way you didn't anticipate when you 
	created the profile. If the template expects a value for a field that was left blank, 
	there may be an awkward passage in the generated text.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the novel <i>Dracula</i>, for example, there is a paragraph that begins 
	<i>The Count halted, putting down my bags...</i>. If the character substituted 
	for Dracula has no value for the name prefix, the generated text would 
	read, <i>The halted, putting down my bags...</i>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Such an error could be difficult to spot while proof reading. Better to provide 
	something for the prefix (Mr. or Miss, if nothing else comes to mind) when 
	creating the profile.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you do use the character as a substitute, be sure to provide a value for each 
	of the names that are defined for the template character that your character profile 
	will stand in for.
