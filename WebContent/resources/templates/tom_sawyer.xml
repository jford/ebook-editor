Then <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> waylaid other <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> seat and started a quarrel with the first <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias> that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> pulled a boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> say "Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his teacher. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s whole class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of two years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> expressed it) had always made this boy come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_222"><![CDATA[In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_223"><![CDATA["Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There--that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good." And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_224"><![CDATA[The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName> and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_225"><![CDATA[A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast>, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. The lady was leading a child. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329148303 name>'s eye, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> could not brook <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329148303)> loving gaze. But when <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> saw this small newcomer <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was "showing off" with all <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> might--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 alias>girl</alias> and win <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> applause. <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> exaltation had but one alloy--the memory of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> humiliation in this angel's garden--and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_226"><![CDATA[The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from <tom_sawyer_template_geoloc_1453592012051 name>, twelve miles away--so he had travelled, and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast>, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast> immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_228"><![CDATA[Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian "showed off"--running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers "showed off"--bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers "showed off" with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls "showed off" in various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was "showing off," too.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_229"><![CDATA[There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_230"><![CDATA[And now at this moment, when hope was dead, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 name> came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> for the wealth <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_231"><![CDATA[The prize was delivered to <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias> had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> premises--a dozen would strain <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> capacity, without a doubt.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_248"><![CDATA[About half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 formalName> came, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName> and Mary sat with <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029)>--<tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> being placed next the aisle, in order that <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that <tom_sawyer_template_geoloc_1453329471591 name> could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been "thrown up to them" so much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays--accidentally. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> had no handkerchief, and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> looked upon boys who had as snobs.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_249"><![CDATA[The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery.

At church "sociables" he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and "wall" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, "Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_254"><![CDATA[After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_255"><![CDATA[And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_256"><![CDATA[There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias> whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> only endured it--if <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> even did that much. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was restive all through it; <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was not listening, but <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> ear detected it and <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> whole nature resented it; <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> and tortured <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare--<getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> believed <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> soul would be instantly destroyed if <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 alias>aunt</alias> detected the act and made <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> let it go.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_257"><![CDATA[The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> counted the pages of the sermon; after church <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> always knew how many pages there had been, but <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> seldom knew anything else about the discourse. However, this time <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was really interested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias>; <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations; <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> face lit with the thought, and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> said to himself that <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> wished <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> could be that child, if it was a tame lion.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_258"><![CDATA[Now <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> bethought <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> of a treasure <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> had and got it out. It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a "pinchbug," <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias>'s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.]]></textblock>

So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> gave it up. It seemed to <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, <tom_sawyer_template_loc_1453332520979 name> lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> hand wandered into <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> pocket and <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> released the tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.]]></textblock>

This bosom friend was <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 name>. The two <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName> took a pin out of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889)> lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.

This change of base occurred often.

At last luck seemed to settle and abide with <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName>. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s fingers would be twitching to begin, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName>'s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_536"><![CDATA[At half-past nine, that night, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName> were sent to bed, as usual. They said their prayers, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName> was soon asleep. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> lay awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> that it must be nearly daylight, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> would have tossed and fidgeted, as <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> nerves demanded, but <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was afraid <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> might wake <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName>. So <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 formalName>'s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> shudder--it meant that somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> was in an agony. At last <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> began to doze, in spite of <getHimselfHerself(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)>; the clock chimed eleven, but <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)>. A cry of "Scat! you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 alias>aunt</alias>'s woodshed brought <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> wide awake, and a single minute later <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the "ell" on all fours. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> "meow'd" with caution once or twice, as <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 formalName> was there, with <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> dead cat.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_537"><![CDATA[It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. "Sacred to the memory of" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.]]></textblock>

Presently Jeff <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast> hove in sight, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> accosted him; and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark about <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameFirst>, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> watched and watched, hoping <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 gdescriptor>whenever a frisking frock came in sight</gdescriptor>, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> was not the right one.

Then <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 gdescriptor>one more frock passed</gdescriptor> in at the gate, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s heart gave a great bound. The next instant <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was out, and "going on" like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> head--doing all the heroic things <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 name> was noticing. But <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> seemed to be unconscious of it all; <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> never looked.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_760"><![CDATA[Three miles below <tom_sawyer_template_geoloc_1453329471591 name>, at a point where the <tom_sawyer_template_loc_1453417600936 name> was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So <tom_sawyer_template_loc_1453417694058 name> was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them.

Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would "hear something."

The river was not high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, "looking <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> last" upon the scene of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> former joys and <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> later sufferings, and wishing "<getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)>" could see <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> doom with a grim smile on <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> lips.

The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_816"><![CDATA[Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an intruder came, now, that would not "down." It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only "hooking," while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_818"><![CDATA[When <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> awoke in the morning, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> wondered where <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> sat up and rubbed <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> eyes and looked around. Then <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> comprehended. It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName> and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> still slept.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_819"><![CDATA[Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias>. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and "sniffing around," then proceeding again--for he was measuring, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> said; and when the worm approached <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)>, of its own accord, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> sat as still as a stone, with <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s leg and began a journey over <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)>, <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> whole heart was glad--for that meant that <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and she took wing and went off to see about it--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias>'s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys</gdescriptor>, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_820"><![CDATA[<tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_821"><![CDATA[They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName> was slicing bacon for breakfast, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> asked <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889)> to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName> had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_822"><![CDATA[They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> had a smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_823"><![CDATA[They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag, and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness. Even <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 nameLast> the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads.

But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>started, glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_831"><![CDATA[They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>could not determine what the men in them were doing.

They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 shortName> could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were.

A furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_931"><![CDATA[But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_932"><![CDATA[Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but heedless <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>lads</gdescriptor>, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_933"><![CDATA[As the sun began to steal in upon the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys</gdescriptor>, drowsiness came over them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_934"><![CDATA[By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_935"><![CDATA[They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_936"><![CDATA[And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at present.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_938"><![CDATA[But there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday afternoon. The <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 nameLast>s, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 formalName>'s family, were being put into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience. The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_941"><![CDATA[Presently <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> stopped, and said to <getHimselfHerself(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)>:]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_944"><![CDATA[Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>last in life, and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who <i>did</i> see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all the rest.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_946"><![CDATA[But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_947"><![CDATA[When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None could remember when the little church had been so full before. There was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 formalName> entered, followed by <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName> and Mary, and they by the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329374889 nameLast> family, all in deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: "I am the Resurrection and the Life."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_948"><![CDATA[As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>lads </gdescriptor>that every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys</gdescriptor>. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_949"><![CDATA[There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed!

By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> shot a glance at <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName>. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> did, with a gun levelled at its head.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1110"><![CDATA[Vacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on "Examination" day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the signpainter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would "manage the thing" while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1111"><![CDATA[In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1112"><![CDATA[The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage," etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1113"><![CDATA[A little shamefaced girl lisped, "Mary had a little lamb," etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy.]]></textblock>

A ghastly stage-fright seized <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)>, <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> legs quaked under <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was like to choke.

The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1115"><![CDATA["The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The Assyrian Came Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original "compositions" by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to "expression" and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. "Friendship" was one; "Memories of Other Days"; "Religion in History"; "Dream Land"; "The Advantages of Culture"; "Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted"; "Melancholy"; "Filial Love"; "Heart Longings," etc., etc.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1116"><![CDATA[A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine language"; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.]]></textblock>

She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived--unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented."]]></textblock>

But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate--for the signpainter's boy had <i>gilded</i> it!]]></textblock>

Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.]]></textblock>

Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud--there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand.

Then it occurred to <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the quantity of coin <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> had seen was too vast to be real. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was like all <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boys </gdescriptor>of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> age and station in life, in that <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> imagined that all references to "hundreds" and "thousands" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one's possession. If <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1505"><![CDATA[The first thing <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news--Judge <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast>'s family had come back to town the night before. Both <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453344047999 name> and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName> took the chief place in the <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 gdescriptor>boy</gdescriptor>'s interest. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> saw <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> and they had an exhausting good time playing "hispy" and "gully-keeper" with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName> teased <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. The child's delight was boundless; and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s not more moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s excitement enabled <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> had good hopes of hearing <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName>'s "maow," and of having <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> treasure to astonish <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName> and the picnickers with, next day; but <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> was disappointed.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1506"><![CDATA[Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast>'s, and everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650 shortName> was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329537650)>.

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1519"><![CDATA[The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName>'s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> that maybe <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> anticipations. Still <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> give it up, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>boy</alias>-like, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow <getHimselfHerself(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> to think of the box of money another time that day.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1520"><![CDATA[Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1521"><![CDATA["Who's ready for the cave?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1522"><![CDATA[Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man "knew" the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 name> knew as much of the cave as any one.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1523"><![CDATA[The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the "known" ground.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1524"><![CDATA[By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1525"><![CDATA[<tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> was already upon <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> watch when the ferryboat's lights went glinting past the wharf. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf--and then <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> dropped her out of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> mind and put <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> attention upon <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened. <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> faith was weakening. Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1526"><![CDATA[A noise fell upon <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> ear. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> was all attention in an instant. The alley door closed softly. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two men brushed by <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)>, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box and never be found again. No, <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> would stick to their wake and follow them; <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So communing with <getHimselfHerself(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)>, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1527"><![CDATA[They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up <tom_sawyer_template_loc_1453332520979 name>; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman's house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName>, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> closed up and shortened <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> distance, now, for they would never be able to see <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)>. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> trotted along awhile; then slackened <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> pace, fearing <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> seemed to hear the beating of <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> own heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)>! <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName>'s heart shot into <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> throat, but <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> swallowed it again; and then <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> at once, and so weak that <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> thought <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> must surely fall to the ground. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> knew where <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> was. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> knew <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas' grounds.

One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast> swooned away. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029 formalName> fell to crying and wringing <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329428029)> hands.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1622"><![CDATA[Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names "<tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 alias>BECKY</alias> & <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 alias>TOM</alias>" had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 nameLast> recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.]]></textblock>

No one had heart for anything. The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755 shortName> feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly dreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453338487755)> had been ill.]]></textblock>

They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room," "The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> and <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName> engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> squeezed <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> small body behind it in order to illuminate it for <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName>'s gratification. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="tom_sawyer_template_textblock_1635"><![CDATA[<tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName> responded to <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> call, and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> seized <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName>'s hand and hurried <getHimHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName>'s light out with its wing while <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551)> was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210 shortName> found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329448210)> wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453329349551 shortName> said:]]></textblock>

The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away <tom_sawyer_template_char_1453344047999 name> could not have squeezed <getHisHer(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453344047999)> body under the door, and <getHeShe(tom_sawyer_template_char_1453344047999)> knew it.

The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was "news."]]></textblock>
