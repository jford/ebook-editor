<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_5"><![CDATA[ <i>3 May. Bistritz.</i>--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_6"><![CDATA[We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. <i>Mem.</i>, get recipe for <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_7"><![CDATA[Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_8"><![CDATA[In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. <i>Mem.</i>, I must ask <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> all about them.)]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_9"><![CDATA[I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call "impletata." <i>Mem.</i>, get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_10"><![CDATA[All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_11"><![CDATA[It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_12"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_29 formalName> had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, "<dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>The Herr Englishman</gdescriptor>?" "Yes," I said, "<dracula_template_char_30 name>." She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_13"><![CDATA["My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_15"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_29 name>."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_16"><![CDATA[ <i>4 May.</i>--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, directing <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew <dracula_template_char_29 formalName>, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_17"><![CDATA[Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_18"><![CDATA["Must you go? Oh! <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>young Herr</gdescriptor>, must you go?" She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_19"><![CDATA["Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_20"><![CDATA["Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_21"><![CDATA["It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?" She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>as an English Churchman</gdescriptor>, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach <dracula_template_char_31 shortName> before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_23"><![CDATA[<i>5 May. The Castle.</i>--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_24"><![CDATA[When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning "word-bearer"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "pokol"--hell, "stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. <i>Mem.</i>, I must ask the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> about these superstitions)]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_25"><![CDATA[When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown person; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_26"><![CDATA[I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_27"><![CDATA[Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_28"><![CDATA["Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_29"><![CDATA[As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. "No, no," he said; "you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce"; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--"and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep." The only stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_30"><![CDATA[When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_31"><![CDATA["There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a caleche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>, with a <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>long brown beard</gdescriptor> and a great black hat, which seemed to hide <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> turned to us. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said to the driver:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_32"><![CDATA["You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_33"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>The English Herr was in a hurry</gdescriptor>," to which the stranger replied:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_34"><![CDATA["That is why, I suppose, you wished <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift." As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> spoke <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_35"><![CDATA["Denn die Todten reiten schnell"--("For the dead travel fast.")]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_36"><![CDATA[The strange driver evidently heard the words, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. "<dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>Give me the Herr's luggage</gdescriptor>," said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the caleche. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the caleche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> strength must have been prodigious. Without a word <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> shook <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_37"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>The night is chill, mein Herr</gdescriptor>, and my master the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it." I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_38"><![CDATA[Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to jump from the caleche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> seat, and shaking <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_39"><![CDATA[Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> kept turning <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_40"><![CDATA[Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went rapidly to where the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> stood between me and the flame <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_41"><![CDATA[At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had yet gone, and during <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_42"><![CDATA[All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coach driver to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> approach. I shouted and beat the side of the caleche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> a chance of reaching the trap. How <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> came there, I know not, but I heard <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> stand in the roadway. As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> swept <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_43"><![CDATA[When I could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_46"><![CDATA[ <i>5 May.</i>--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_47"><![CDATA[When the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> prodigious strength. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had chosen. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_48"><![CDATA[I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitor</attribute>'s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> estate to a foreigner? <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>Solicitor</attribute>'s clerk! <dracula_template_char_31 shortName> would not like that. <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>Solicitor</attribute>--for just before leaving <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitor</attribute>! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_49"><![CDATA[Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_50"><![CDATA[Within, stood a tall old <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>, <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>clean shaven save for a long white moustache</gdescriptor>, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> anywhere. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> held in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door. The old <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> motioned me in with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_51"><![CDATA["Welcome to my house!

The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> moved impulsively forward, and holding out <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_53"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_29 formalName>?" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> bowed in a courtly way as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> replied:--]]></textblock>

I protested but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> insisted:--]]></textblock>

Let me see to your comfort myself." <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily. At the end of this <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_56"><![CDATA[The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.

It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> closed the door:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_59"><![CDATA[I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand to the table, and said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_64"><![CDATA[By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> offered me, at the same time excusing <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, and found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> of a very marked physiognomy.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_65"><![CDATA[<getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>under the heavy moustache,</gdescriptor> was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> years. For the rest, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_66"><![CDATA[Hitherto I had noticed the backs of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hands as they lay on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point. As the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> leaned over me and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had yet done <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> protuberant teeth, sat <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> down again on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own side of the fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s eyes gleamed, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_67"><![CDATA["Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!" Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> added:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_68"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>Ah, sir</gdescriptor>, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter." Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> rose and said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_70"><![CDATA[I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_72"><![CDATA[<i>7 May.</i>--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which was written:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_73"><![CDATA["I have to be absent for a while. <dracula_template_char_29 descriptor>Do not wait for me.--D.</descriptor>" I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one. There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value. The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair</gdescriptor>. I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves. Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s permission. There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_74"><![CDATA[In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>English magazines and newspapers</attribute>, though none of them were of very recent date. The books were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, lawall relating --<dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>to England and English life and customs and manners</attribute>. There were even such books of reference as the <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the Law List.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_75"><![CDATA[Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> entered. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night's rest. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_76"><![CDATA["I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you. These companions"--and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> laid <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand on some of the books--"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, have given me many, many hours of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>; and to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_77"><![CDATA["But, <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>," I said, "you know and speak English thoroughly!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> bowed gravely.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_78"><![CDATA["I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_79"><![CDATA["Indeed," I said, "you speak excellently."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_80"><![CDATA["Not so," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> answered. "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am <i>boyar</i>; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is no one; men know <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> see me, or pause in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> speaking if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name>, to tell me all about my new estate in <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>. You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>English </attribute>intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_81"><![CDATA[Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He answered: "Yes, certainly," and added:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_82"><![CDATA["You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand." I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_83"><![CDATA["We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange things there may be."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_84"><![CDATA[This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> wanted to talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>the coachman </gdescriptor>went to the places where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had seen the blue flames. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. "That treasure has been hidden," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went on, "in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_85"><![CDATA["But how," said I, "can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?" The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> smiled, and as <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> lips ran back over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> answered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_86"><![CDATA["Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_87"><![CDATA["There you are right," I said. "I know no more than the dead where even to look for them." Then we drifted into other matters.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_88"><![CDATA["Come," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said at last, "tell me of <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> and of the house which you have procured for me." With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the <dracula_template_char_37 namePrefix> lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>English Bradshaw's Guide</attribute>. When I came in <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> cleared the books and papers from the table; and with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> clearly had studied beforehand all <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> evidently at the end knew very much more than I did. When I remarked this, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> answered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_89"><![CDATA["Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there I shall be all alone, and >my friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast> <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>--nay, pardon me, I fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend <dracula_template_char_30 name> will not be by my side to correct and aid me. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> will be in <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name>, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_90"><![CDATA[We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at <dracula_template_geoloc_9 name>. When I had told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> the facts and got <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place. I read to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_91"><![CDATA["At <dracula_template_geoloc_9 name>, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_92"><![CDATA["The estate is called <dracula_template_loc_11 name>, no doubt a corruption of the old <i>Quatre Face</i>, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, <dracula_template_loc_11 attribute>to medieval times</attribute>, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_93"><![CDATA[When I had finished, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_94"><![CDATA["I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may." Somehow <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> words and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> look did not seem to accord, or else it was that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> cast of face made <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> smile look malignant and saturnine.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_95"><![CDATA[Presently, with an excuse, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> left me, asking me to put all my papers together. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> on the east side, manifestly where <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> new estate was situated; the other two were <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name>, and <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>on the Yorkshire coast</attribute>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_96"><![CDATA[It was the better part of an hour when the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> returned. "Aha!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said; "still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I am informed that your supper is ready." <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> again excused <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had dined out on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> being away from home. But <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; <dracula_template_char_29 formalName>, jumping to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> feet, said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_97"><![CDATA["Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name> less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us," and, with a courtly bow, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> quickly left me.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_98"><![CDATA[I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_100"><![CDATA[<i>8 May.</i>--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_101"><![CDATA[I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave</gdescriptor>. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s voice saying to me, "Good-morning." I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. <dracula_template_char_30 descriptor>In starting I had cut myself slightly</descriptor>, but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> was close to me, and I could see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> is near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>I laid down the razor</gdescriptor>, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> saw my face <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_102"><![CDATA["Take care," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said, "take care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous than you think in this country." Then seizing <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>the shaving glass</gdescriptor>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went on: "And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!" and opening the heavy window with one wrench of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> terrible hand, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal</gdescriptor>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_103"><![CDATA[When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen <dracula_template_char_29 alias>the Count</alias> eat or drink. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must be a very peculiar <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_108"><![CDATA[ When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to <dracula_template_char_29 alias>the Count</alias>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> knows well that I am imprisoned; and as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has done it <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>, and has doubtless <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own motives for it, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would only deceive me if I trusted <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_109"><![CDATA[I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> had returned. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> does <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been <dracula_template_char_29 alias>the Count</alias> <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could control the wolves, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did, by only holding up <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about <dracula_template_char_29 formalName>, as it may help me to understand. To-night <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> may talk of <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, however, not to awake <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> suspicion.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_111"><![CDATA[<i>Midnight.</i>--I have had a long talk with the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>. I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> a few questions on Transylvania history, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> spoke as if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had been present at them all. This <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> afterwards explained by saying that to a <i>boyar</i> the pride of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> house and name is <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own pride, that their glory is <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> glory, that their fate is <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> fate. Whenever <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> spoke of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> house <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> always said "we," and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put down all <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said exactly as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said it, for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> grew excited as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> spoke, and walked about the room <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>pulling <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> great white moustache </gdescriptor>and grasping anything on which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> laid <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hands as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would crush it by main strength. One thing <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> race:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_112"><![CDATA["We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> held up <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> arms. "Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, 'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> indeed! Woe was it that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own unworthy brother, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had fallen, sold <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>, indeed, who inspired that other of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> race who in a later age again and again brought <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had to come alone from the bloody field where <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> troops were being slaughtered, since <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> knew that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> alone could ultimately triumph! They said that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> thought only of <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys--and the <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> as their heart's blood, their brains, and their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told."]]></textblock>

I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> came from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> room <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain method in the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_116"><![CDATA[First, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> asked if a man in <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name> might have two <dracula_template_geoloc_1 attribute>solicitors</attribute> or more. I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might have a dozen if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one <dracula_template_geoloc_1 attribute>solicitor</attribute> engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> interest. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking <dracula_template_geoloc_1 attribute>solicitor</attribute>. I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_117"><![CDATA["I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name>, which is far from <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, buys for me through your good self my place at <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>. Good! Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover</attribute>, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?" I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitors</attribute> had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitor</attribute>, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_120"><![CDATA["Good!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against. I explained all these things to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to the best of my ability, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> certainly left me under the impression that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would have made a wonderful <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitor</attribute>, for there was nothing that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did not think of or foresee. For a <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> knowledge and acumen were wonderful.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_121"><![CDATA["Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?"

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_125"><![CDATA[What could I do but bow acceptance?

It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not so?" As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> spoke <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, and noticing <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, for to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_31)> I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> wrote several notes, referring as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> wrote them to some books on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> table. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> took up my two and placed them with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own, and put by <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_132"><![CDATA[When <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_133"><![CDATA[What I saw was the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s head coming out from the window. I did not see the face, but I knew the <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> by the neck and the movement of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>amuse a man</gdescriptor> when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, <i>face down</i> with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> cloak spreading out around <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_136"><![CDATA[<i>15 May.</i>--Once more have I seen the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> go out in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> lizard fashion. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> vanished into some hole or window. When <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s room; I must watch should a door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere "modernity" cannot kill.]]></textblock>

Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past. Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> is the least dreadful to me; that to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> purpose.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_142"><![CDATA[When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_143"><![CDATA[I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>'s eyes and cause <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_31)> pain; but it is the truth. They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on. One said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_144"><![CDATA["Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin." The other added:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_145"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> is young and strong; there are kisses for us all." I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation. The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_146"><![CDATA[I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating heart.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_147"><![CDATA[But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, and of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> arm, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> hurled the woman from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, and then motioned to the others, as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_148"><![CDATA["How dare you touch <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> when I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>This man belongs to me</gdescriptor>! Beware how you meddle with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, or you'll have to deal with me." The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_149"><![CDATA["You yourself never loved; you never love!" On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends. Then the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_150"><![CDATA["Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> you shall kiss <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, for there is work to be done."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_151"><![CDATA["Are we to have nothing to-night?" said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> nodded <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_155"><![CDATA[ I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> must have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> carried me here and undressed me, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must have been hurried in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> task, for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would not have brooked. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would have taken or destroyed it.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_159"><![CDATA[<i>19 May.</i>--I am surely in the toils. Last night the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> whilst I am so absolutely in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> power; and to refuse would be to excite <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> suspicion and to arouse <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> anger. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape. I saw in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> hurled that fair woman from him. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> assured me with so much impressiveness that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> would have been to create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> views, and asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> what dates I should put on the letters. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> calculated a minute, and then said:--]]></textblock>

It is not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us." And <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed.

With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_181"><![CDATA[Then I ran to the window and cried to them.

Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.]]></textblock>

I thought I would watch for the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, for there is something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind.

I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_187"><![CDATA[Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.]]></textblock>

She was leaning against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--]]></textblock>

When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_202"><![CDATA[<i>Same day, later.</i>--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_203"><![CDATA[At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_204"><![CDATA[There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>! <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was either dead or asleep, I could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I thought <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think....]]></textblock>

As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would have any effect on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_217"><![CDATA[Close at hand came the howling of many wolves.

After a pause of a moment, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> proceeded, in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_218"><![CDATA[To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_219"><![CDATA[As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> was useless. With such allies as these at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> command, I could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, and as a last chance I cried out:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_220"><![CDATA["Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!" and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_227"><![CDATA[At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_228"><![CDATA[But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_229"><![CDATA[Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s room. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s room. It was empty, but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_230"><![CDATA[The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, but looking as if <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> youth had been half renewed, for the white hair <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>and moustache</gdescriptor> were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>, where, perhaps, for centuries to come <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_231"><![CDATA[I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom <dracula_template_char_29 alias>the Count</alias> had spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_232"><![CDATA[As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.

I think <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>is one of the most resolute men</gdescriptor> I ever saw, and yet the most calm. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> must have over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> patients. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one's thoughts. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? <i>I do</i>, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> says that I afford <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind; <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> says that every day. There, it is all out. <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were <i>children</i>; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, couldn't you guess? I love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>. I am blushing as I write, for although I <i>think</i> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> loves me, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> has not told me so in words. But oh, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, I love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>; I love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>; I love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>! There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I <i>do</i> so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you <i>at once</i>, and tell me all that you think about it. <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, I must stop. Good-night.

Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>for two of the poor fellows</gdescriptor>. Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, I am so happy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness' sake, don't tell <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>any of the girls</gdescriptor>, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>they did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain!</gdescriptor> You and I, <dracula_template_char_31 nameFirst> dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>old married women</gdescriptor>, can despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from <i>every one</i>, except, of course, <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>. You will tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>A woman ought to tell her husband everything?</gdescriptor>--don't you think so, dear--and I must be fair. <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>Men like women, certainly their wives</gdescriptor>, to be quite as fair as they are; and <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair</gdescriptor> as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)>, <dracula_template_char_38 namePrefix> <dracula_template_char_38 name>, <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>the lunatic-asylum man,</gdescriptor> with the strong jaw and the good forehead. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> had evidently been schooling <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_38)> as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> almost managed to sit down on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> silk hat, <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>which men don't generally do</gdescriptor> when they are cool, and then when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> wanted to appear at ease <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> spoke to me, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, very straightforwardly. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> told me how dear I was to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)>, though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> had known me so little, and what <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> life would be with me to help and cheer <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> was going to tell me how unhappy <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> would be if I did not care for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)>, but when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> saw me cry <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> said that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> broke off and asked if I could love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> in time; and when I shook my head <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> hands trembled, and then with some hesitation <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was free <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>a man might have hope</gdescriptor>. And then, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, I felt a sort of duty to tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> that there was some one. I only told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> that much, and then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> stood up, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> looked very strong and very grave as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> took both my hands in his and said <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> one of my best. Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName> dear, I can't help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at all a happy thing when you have to <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>see a poor fellow</gdescriptor>, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_261"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> is such a nice fellow, <dracula_template_char_39 descriptor>an American from Texas</descriptor>, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose that <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him</gdescriptor>. I know now what I would do <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me</gdescriptor>. No, I don't, for there was <dracula_template_char_39 formalName> telling us <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> stories, and <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> never told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. <dracula_template_char_39 namePrefix> <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> <dracula_template_char_39 nameMiddle> <dracula_template_char_39 nameLast> found me alone. <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>It seems that a man always does find a girl alone.</gdescriptor> No, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> doesn't, for <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> tried twice to <i>make</i> a chance, and I helping <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you beforehand that <dracula_template_char_39 formalName> doesn't always speak slang--that is to say, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> never does so to strangers or before them, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> is really well educated and has exquisite manners--but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> found out that it amused me to hear <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> said such funny things. I am afraid, my dear, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> likes it, as I have never heard <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> use any as yet. Well, <dracula_template_char_39 formalName> sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> could, but I could see all the same that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was very nervous. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> took my hand in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)>, and said ever so sweetly:--]]></textblock>

Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> said that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> had spoken in a light manner, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> hoped that if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)>, I would forgive <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> really did look serious when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was saying it, and I couldn't help feeling a bit serious too--I know, <dracula_template_char_31 shortName>, you will think me a horrid flirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was number two in one day.

A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> Abbey, <dracula_template_geoloc_11 attribute>which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of "Marmion," where the girl was built up in the wall</attribute>. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland <dracula_template_geoloc_11 attribute>called Kettleness</attribute> stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_292"><![CDATA[The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_293"><![CDATA[It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely <dracula_template_geoloc_11 attribute>the stream of the Esk</attribute>, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he is coming this way....]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_294"><![CDATA[He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought.

I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_297"><![CDATA[He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. <dracula_template_char_33 nameFirst> went out visiting with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go.

He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can't out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. <dracula_template_char_33 nameFirst> was looking sweetly pretty in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>white lawn frock</gdescriptor>; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> has got a beautiful colour since <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> has been here.

Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, but gave me double share instead.

"Then that be just where the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as old Dun's 'bacca-box on Friday night." He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed. "And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!" I went over and read:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_304"><![CDATA["Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, aet. 30." When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--]]></textblock>

Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above"--he pointed northwards--"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in the <i>Lively</i> off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums aboot it!

This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_342"><![CDATA[<i>26 July.</i>--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time. And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I am unhappy about <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> and about <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>. I had not heard from <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> for some time, and was very concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>, and says that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> is just starting for home. That is not like <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>; I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, although <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is so well, has lately taken to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> old habit of walking in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, and she tells me that her husband, <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> is to be married in the autumn, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is already planning out <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>her dresses </gdescriptor>and how <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> house is to be arranged.

To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over <dracula_template_geoloc_11 attribute>Kettleness</attribute>. Everything is grey--except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a "brool" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem "men like trees walking." The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk....]]></textblock>

"There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the air; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call comes!" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_358"><![CDATA[One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to <dracula_template_geoloc_11 descriptor>Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes,</descriptor> and the various trips in the neighbourhood of <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>. The steamers <i>Emma</i> and <i>Scarborough</i> made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of "tripping" both to and from <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>. The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of "mares'-tails" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked "No. 2: light breeze." The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below <dracula_template_geoloc_11 attribute>the black mass of Kettleness</attribute>, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the "Prelude to the Great Storm" will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his "cobble" or his "mule," as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually "hug" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_360"><![CDATA[Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_361"><![CDATA[Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_362"><![CDATA[Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_363"><![CDATA[Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell." Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_364"><![CDATA[There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the "top-hammer" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones--"thruff-steans" or "through-stones," as they call them in the <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_365"><![CDATA[It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_366"><![CDATA[It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a <i>dead hand</i>. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_369"><![CDATA[<i>9 August.</i>--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the <i>Demeter</i>. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> <dracula_template_geoloc_11 attribute>solicitor</attribute>, Mr. S. F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a "nine days' wonder," they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P. C. A., which is very strong in <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_371"><![CDATA[<i>Later.</i>--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the log-book of the <i>Demeter</i>, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my statement must be taken <i>cum grano</i>, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.]]></textblock>

The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear:  <i>It</i> is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air." And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space. Then he went on: "But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm." And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as "clay," and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help....]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_408"><![CDATA[It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear. "Save me! save me!" he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: "You had better come too, captain, before it is too late. <i><dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>He</gdescriptor></i> is there. I know the secret now. The sea will <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>save me from Him</gdescriptor>, and it is all that is left!" Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these horrors when I get to port? <i>When</i> I get to port!

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_418"><![CDATA[<i>10 August.</i>--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortege of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> seemed much upset. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> dreaming at night is telling on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is quite odd in one thing: <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> does not understand it <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_33)>. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> is so sweet and sensitive that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was full of pity, too, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all afford material for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> dreams.]]></textblock>

We had a lovely walk. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital "severe tea" at <dracula_template_loc_35 name> in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have <dracula_template_char_31 gdescriptor>shocked the "New Woman" with our appetites.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_424"><![CDATA[<i>11 August, 3 a. m.</i>--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.... Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I could not see <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s bed; I stole across and felt for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> wore might give me some clue to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> dreaming intention. <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places.</gdescriptor> "Thank God," I said to myself, "<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> cannot be far, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is only in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> nightdress." I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> must have gone out as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, "<dracula_template_char_33 shortName>! <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>!" and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> half reclining with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> head lying over the back of the seat. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_425"><![CDATA[When I bent over <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> I could see that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was still asleep. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lips were parted, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was breathing--not softly as usual with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lungs full at every breath. As I came close, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> put up <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hand in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep and pulled the collar of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> nightdress close around <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat. Whilst <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did so there came a little shudder through <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, and drew the edges tight round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> neck, for I dreaded lest <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was. I feared to wake <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> with it, for by-and-by, when <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breathing became quieter, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> put <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hand to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat again and moaned. When I had <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> feet and then began very gently to wake <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. At first <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not respond; but gradually <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> became more and more uneasy in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> home at once, I shook <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> more forcibly, till finally <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> opened <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes and awoke. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not realise all at once where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> body must have been chilled with cold, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not lose <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> grace. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> to come at once with me home <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> noticed me wince. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_426"><![CDATA[Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or "wynds," as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, not only for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> health, lest <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> should suffer from the exposure, but for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> into bed. Before falling asleep <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> asked--even implored--me not to say a word to any one, even <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother, about <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay, infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....]]></textblock>

The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>; on the contrary, it has benefited <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looks better this morning than <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> has done for weeks.

Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> laughed and petted me, and said <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not even feel it.

Again I awoke in the night, and found <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great, silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey.

This afternoon <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and suddenly <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> murmured as if to <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_33)>:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_437"><![CDATA["<getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> red eyes again! They are just the same." It was such an odd expression, coming <i>apropos</i> of nothing, that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I called <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s attention to the peculiar effect, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> became <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_37)> with a start, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looked sad all the same; it may have been that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> had a headache and went early to bed. I saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>. When coming home--it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance up at our window, and saw <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s head leaning out. I thought that perhaps <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> head lying up against the side of the window-sill and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes shut. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was fast asleep, and by <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was moving back to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was holding <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.]]></textblock>

A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.

I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He ran back and saw <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> should go than to follow <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, as he might lose sight of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_488"><![CDATA[I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of <dracula_template_loc_11 name>, in case our friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast>'s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. On the far side of the house I found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was saying, lest I might frighten <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> should run off.

Then Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> went to lie down, and <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was left with me. We went into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> boudoir, and till we got there <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going.

It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, but regarding which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> can remember nothing. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> says that as a child <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> used to walk in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep, and that when in <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> the habit came back, and that once <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where <dracula_template_char_31 formalName> found her; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> assures me that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of <dracula_template_geoloc_1 name>, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to <dracula_template_char_33 formalName>. This, <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>my dear fellow</gdescriptor>, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see <dracula_template_char_33 formalName> to-morrow again. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother by too early a repetition of my call.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_557"><![CDATA["Well, as to the visit. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was more cheerful than on the day I first saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, and certainly looked better. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breathing was normal. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was very sweet to the professor (as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; though I could see that <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>the poor girl</gdescriptor> was making a hard struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_558"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>'My dear young miss</gdescriptor>, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale. To them I say: "Pouf!"' And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)>'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything of a <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>young ladies?</gdescriptor> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> has <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> madams to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter</gdescriptor>, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has been, but is not. But the conditions of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> are in no way anemic. I have asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> to send me <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> interest me too. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> charm me, and for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, if not for you or disease, I come.']]></textblock>

Just before the stroke of noon <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> became so violent that it took all their strength to hold <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. In about five minutes, however, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_563"><![CDATA[<i>Later.</i>--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, and found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> seemingly as happy and contented as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> used to be. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> saw me, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> came over and apologised for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> own room and to have <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> note-book again. I thought it well to humour <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>: so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> is back in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> room with the window open. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> has the sugar of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> room to find a spider. I tried to get <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> to talk about the past few days, for any clue to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> thoughts would be of immense help to me; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would not rise. For a moment or two <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_36)> than to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_564"><![CDATA["All over! all over! <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do it for myself!"

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_566"><![CDATA["Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it."

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_568"><![CDATA[<i>Midnight.</i>--Another change in <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. I had been to see <dracula_template_char_33 formalName>, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> yelling. As <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> just as the sun was going down, and from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> window saw the red disc sink. As it sank <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> became less and less frenzied; and just as it dipped <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> slid from the hands that held <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> stood up quite calmly and looked around <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. I signalled to the attendants not to hold <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, for I was anxious to see what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would do. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> bed. All this surprised me, so I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>: "Are you not going to keep flies any more?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_569"><![CDATA["No," said <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)>; "I am sick of all that rubbish!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> mind or of the cause of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue after all, if we can find why to-day <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others? We shall see.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_585"><![CDATA["Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_586"><![CDATA["No," I said. "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as <dracula_template_char_33 formalName> was not so well, and that I should let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> know if need be."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_587"><![CDATA["Right, my friend," he said, "quite right! Better <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> not know as yet; perhaps <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> shall know all. And, my good friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen, too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. "I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_588"><![CDATA["Why not now?" I asked. "It may do some good; we may arrive at some decision." He stopped and looked at me, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_589"><![CDATA["My friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when the time comes.'" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: "The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all, there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell." He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_590"><![CDATA["You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this case of <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>our dear miss</gdescriptor> is one that may be--mind, I say <i>may be</i>--of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_591"><![CDATA[When I described <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>daughter </gdescriptor>to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_592"><![CDATA[I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> or think of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s room. If I was shocked when I saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> yesterday, I was horrified when I saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> to-day. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lips and gums, and the bones of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> face stood out prominently; <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?"]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_595"><![CDATA[I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was stepping quickly in. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:--]]></textblock>

The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> he had been angry at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> stalwart proportions and recognised the <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>strong young manhood</gdescriptor> which seemed to emanate from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>, his eyes gleamed.

For <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. "You are to help <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_598"><![CDATA["What can I do?" asked <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it.

Van Helsing slapped <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> on the shoulder. "Come!" he said. "<dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>You are a man, and it is a man we want. </gdescriptor>You are better than me, better than my friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>." <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_605"><![CDATA[We all went up to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s room. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> by direction remained outside. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was not asleep, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was simply too weak to make the effort. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes spoke to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_606"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>Now, little miss</gdescriptor>, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes." <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had made the effort with success.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_607"><![CDATA[It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked the extent of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was satisfied he called <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> into the room, and bade <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> strip off <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> coat. Then he added: "You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, help to me!" So neither of us looked whilst <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> bent over <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_608"><![CDATA[Van Helsing turning to me, said:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_609"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_610"><![CDATA[Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s cheeks, and through <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s growing pallor the joy of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>strong man</gdescriptor> as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s system must have undergone that what weakened <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> only partially restored <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: "Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>; I will look to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>." When all was over I could see how much <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was weakened. I dressed the wound and took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> arm to bring <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_611"><![CDATA["The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> shall have presently." And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> seems always to wear round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lover had given <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: "Now take down our brave young lover, give <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> of the port wine, and let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> lie down a while. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> may be recruited of what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> has so given to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> love. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> must not stay here. Hold! a moment. <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>I may take it, sir,</gdescriptor> that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful. You have saved <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> all when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is well;  shall <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)>love you none the less for what you have done. Good-bye."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_612"><![CDATA[When <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> had gone I went back to the room. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was sleeping gently, but <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_613"><![CDATA["What do you make of that mark on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> throat?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_614"><![CDATA["What do you make of it?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_615"><![CDATA["I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>the girl</gdescriptor> must have lost to leave such a pallor as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had before the transfusion.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_616"><![CDATA["Well?" said Van Helsing.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_617"><![CDATA["Well," said I, "I can make nothing of it." The Professor stood up. "I must go back to <dracula_template_geoloc_1 name> to-night," he said. "There are books and things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_618"><![CDATA["Shall I have a nurse?" I asked.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_619"><![CDATA["We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is well fed, and that nothing disturbs <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. You must not sleep all the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And then we may begin."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_620"><![CDATA["May begin?" I said. "What on earth do you mean?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_621"><![CDATA["We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_622"><![CDATA["Remember, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is your charge. If you leave <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!"]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_624"><![CDATA[<i>8 September.</i>--I sat up all night with <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> waked naturally; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looked a different being from what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had been before the operation. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> spirits even were good, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had undergone. When I told Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>her daughter's</gdescriptor> renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil. When <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> maid had prepared <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eye. After a long spell <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_33)> together and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_625"><![CDATA["You do not want to go to sleep?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_626"><![CDATA["No; I am afraid."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_629"><![CDATA["A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_630"><![CDATA["I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_631"><![CDATA["But, <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>my dear girl</gdescriptor>, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_632"><![CDATA["Ah, I can trust you!" I seized the opportunity, and said: "I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_633"><![CDATA["You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will sleep!" And almost at the word <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_634"><![CDATA[All night long I watched by <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lips were slightly parted, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was a smile on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> peace of mind.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_635"><![CDATA[In the early morning <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> maid came, and I left <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, telling them of the excellent result of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoophagous patient. The report was good; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had been quite quiet for the past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at <dracula_template_geoloc_1 name> whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at <dracula_template_loc_12 name> to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_637"><![CDATA[<i>9 September</i>.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to <dracula_template_loc_12 name>. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was up and in cheerful spirits. When <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> shook hands with me <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looked sharply in my face and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_638"><![CDATA["No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you." I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> came with me, and, enlivened by <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> took me upstairs, and showed me a room next <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> own, where a cozy fire was burning. "Now," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> said, "you must stay here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once." I could not but acquiesce, for I was "dog-tired," and could not have sat up had I tried. So, on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> renewing <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> promise to call me if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_640"><![CDATA[<i>9 September.</i>--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> presence warm about me. I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of last night!

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_643"><![CDATA["And how is our patient?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_644"><![CDATA["Well, when I left <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, or rather when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> left me," I answered.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_645"><![CDATA["Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into the room.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_646"><![CDATA[The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_647"><![CDATA[As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement from his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_648"><![CDATA[There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly. "Quick!" he said. "Bring the brandy." I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felt <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_649"><![CDATA["It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is undone; we must begin again. There is no young <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>." As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing held up a warning finger. "Do not stir," he said, "but I fear that with growing strength <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia." He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>No man knows</gdescriptor>, till <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> experiences it, what it is to feel <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> own life-blood drawn away into the veins of <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>the woman</gdescriptor> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> loves.]]></textblock>

I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_653"><![CDATA["Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_656"><![CDATA[I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> had made such a retrograde movement, and how <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges--tiny though they were.]]></textblock>

When Van Helsing had seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> for a moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_658"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_33 shortName> chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened.

When <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother came up to see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_659"><![CDATA["We owe you so much, <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.

As she spoke, <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> turned imploring eyes on me.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_660"><![CDATA[Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: "Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong.

They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the "foreign gentleman." I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman's kindness.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_665"><![CDATA["For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_666"><![CDATA["Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines." Here <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> made a wry face. "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> what woes <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> so loves so much distort. Aha, <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>my pretty miss</gdescriptor>, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_667"><![CDATA[Whilst he was speaking, <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> had been examining the flowers and smelling them. Now <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_668"><![CDATA["Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_669"><![CDATA[To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_670"><![CDATA["No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own." Then seeing poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> scared, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> might well be, he went on more gently: "<dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>Oh, little miss</gdescriptor>, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from <dracula_template_geoloc_5 name>, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_671"><![CDATA[We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_672"><![CDATA["Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_673"><![CDATA["Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was to wear round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> neck.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_674"><![CDATA[We then waited whilst <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> made <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> toilet for the night, and when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> neck. The last words he said to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> were:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_675"><![CDATA["Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_676"><![CDATA["I promise," said <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, "and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_677"><![CDATA[As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_678"><![CDATA["To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>pretty miss</gdescriptor>, so much more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_679"><![CDATA[He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.]]></textblock>

He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with "virgin crants and maiden strewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody.]]></textblock>

The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_685"><![CDATA[Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at <dracula_template_loc_12 name> at eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> coming out of the morning room. She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_686"><![CDATA["You will be glad to know that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> is better. The dear child is still asleep. I looked into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>." The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He rubbed his hands together, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_687"><![CDATA["Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working," to which she answered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_688"><![CDATA["You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s state this morning is due in part to me."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_689"><![CDATA["How you do mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_690"><![CDATA["Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> room. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did not wake <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had actually a bunch of them round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, I am sure."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_691"><![CDATA[She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_692"><![CDATA[Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. "God! God! God!" he said. "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>lose her daughter </gdescriptor>body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!" Suddenly he jumped to his feet. "Come," he said, "come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same." He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s room.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_693"><![CDATA[Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_694"><![CDATA["As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand. "No!" he said. "To-day you must operate. I shall provide. You are weakened already." As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_695"><![CDATA[Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_696"><![CDATA[Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> that she must not remove anything from <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s room without consulting him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_697"><![CDATA[After another hour <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> waked from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> terrible ordeal.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_700"><![CDATA[<i>17 September.</i>--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from <dracula_template_geoloc_7 name>0. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in <dracula_template_geoloc_5 name>. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.]]></textblock>

Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called "business" until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--]]></textblock>

Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But, Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in 'im.

My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he's bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's shop in time.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_737"><![CDATA[The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_742"><![CDATA[<i>17 September.</i>--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> own accord into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's pause <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> made straight at me. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had a dinner-knife in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> hand, and, as I saw <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> could strike again, however, I got in my right and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was sprawling on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, his employment positively sickened me. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: "The blood is the life! The blood is the life!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_743"><![CDATA[I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s illness and its horrible phases is telling on me.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_751"><![CDATA[I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_752"><![CDATA[I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> when <dracula_template_char_31 shortName> saved me, and which now I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> was in the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> would be--so that I might have called <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)>. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: "Is there anybody there?" There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_753"><![CDATA["I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_754"><![CDATA[I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: "What is that?" I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body, which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_755"><![CDATA[The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_756"><![CDATA[My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_757"><![CDATA[The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, if I should not survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_760"><![CDATA[ <i>18 September.</i>--I drove at once to <dracula_template_loc_12 name> and arrived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> or <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_761"><![CDATA[I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_762"><![CDATA["Then it was you, and just arrived. How is <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)>? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_763"><![CDATA[I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_764"><![CDATA["Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!" With his usual recuperative energy, he went on: "Come. If there be no way open to get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_765"><![CDATA[We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: "We can attend to them later." Then we ascended to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_766"><![CDATA[How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>two women</gdescriptor>, <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother. The latter lay farthest in, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> neck we found upon <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother's bosom, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_767"><![CDATA["It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_768"><![CDATA[I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lips and gums and on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> wrists and the palms of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hands. He said to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_769"><![CDATA["I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> will need be heated before we can do anything more."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_770"><![CDATA[I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice <dracula_template_char_33 namePrefix><dracula_template_char_33 shortName>. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> out as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was and placed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> in it. Whilst we were busy chafing <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from <dracula_template_char_37 formalName>. I bade her simply tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_771"><![CDATA[I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_772"><![CDATA["If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> horizon." He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_773"><![CDATA[Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's face almost beamed, and as we lifted <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> from the bath and rolled <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> in a hot sheet to dry <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> he said to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_774"><![CDATA["The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_775"><![CDATA[We took <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_776"><![CDATA[Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> and not to take her eyes off <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_777"><![CDATA["We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_778"><![CDATA["What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>poor girl's life </gdescriptor>won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_779"><![CDATA["What's the matter with me, anyhow?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_780"><![CDATA[The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of <dracula_template_char_39 name>. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: "<dracula_template_char_39 name>!" and rushed towards <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> with outstretched hands.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_781"><![CDATA["What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_785"><![CDATA["I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell me what to do."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_786"><![CDATA[Van Helsing strode forward, and took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> hand, looking <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> straight in the eyes as he said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_787"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_39 gdescriptor>A brave man's blood </gdescriptor>is the best thing on this earth <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>when a woman is in trouble</gdescriptor>. <dracula_template_char_39 gdescriptor>You're a man and no mistake.</gdescriptor> Well, the devil may work against us for all he's worth, but <dracula_template_char_39 gdescriptor>God sends us men when we want them</gdescriptor>."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_788"><![CDATA[Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart to go through with the details. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> had got a terrible shock and it told on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> more than before, for though plenty of blood went into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with <dracula_template_char_39 name>, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: "It dropped from <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s breast when we carried <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> to the bath."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_789"><![CDATA[When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: "In God's name, what does it all mean? Was <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)>, or is <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)>, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?" I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more.

I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> I would see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> as soon as I knew about <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, and went up to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> room. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature. So I went down to <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> said to me:--]]></textblock>

I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. <dracula_template_char_38 shortName>, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was the first, is not that so?" As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> spoke <dracula_template_char_39 gdescriptor>the poor fellow </gdescriptor>looked terribly anxious. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was in a torture of suspense regarding <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>the woman</gdescriptor> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> loved, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> intensified <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> pain. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> very heart was bleeding, and it <dracula_template_char_39 gdescriptor>took all the manhood</gdescriptor> of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)>--and there was a royal lot of it, too--to keep <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: "That's so."]]></textblock>

The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> should be alarmed. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looked around the room, and seeing where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was, shuddered; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> gave a loud cry, and put <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> poor thin hands before <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> pale face. We both understood what that meant--that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had realised to the full <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother's death; so we tried what we could to comfort <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. Doubtless sympathy eased <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> somewhat, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> that either or both of us would now remain with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> all the time, and that seemed to comfort <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. Towards dusk <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> took the paper from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. All the same, however, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hands; finally <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> lifted <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_808"><![CDATA[When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s strength. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was hardly able to turn <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> head, and the little nourishment which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> could take seemed to do <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> no good.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_809"><![CDATA[When <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks.

In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> rallied a little, and spoke to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> more brightly than <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had done since we arrived. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> too pulled <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_37)> together, and spoke as cheerily as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> could, so that the best was made of everything.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_824"><![CDATA["In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast>, there is more to say. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast>'s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> could lay <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> to "shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar," whereon <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>our man </gdescriptor>accused him of robbing <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> and wanting to murder <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> and said that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild beast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>from our man</gdescriptor>. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> anger, since <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> is usually <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>such a well-behaved man</gdescriptor>, and except <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> manner. I tried to get <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> to talk of the incident, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> cunning, for within half an hour I heard of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> again. This time <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had broken out through the window of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, for I feared <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was intent on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> just at the moment I believe <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was silent in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> fighting; but as we began to master <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me! they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> back to the house and put <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_825"><![CDATA["The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>a feeble madman</gdescriptor>. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent.

It is not only that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> all <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> life, and now at the end has treated <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> like <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>own son </gdescriptor>and left <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> feels it on another account. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> makes <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> nervous. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> begins to doubt <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_30)>. I try to cheer <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> up, and <i>my</i> belief in <i><getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)></i> helps <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> to have a belief in <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_30)>. But it is here that the grave shock that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> experienced tells upon <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)>--a nature which enabled <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father. As there are no relations at all, <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_838"><![CDATA[<i>20 September.</i>--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--<dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s mother and <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_839"><![CDATA[I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>. We wanted <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> to go to rest also, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> refused at first. It was only when I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> that we should want <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> should suffer, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>. "Come, my child," he said; "come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep." <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> went off with him, casting back a longing look on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s face, which lay in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was breathing somewhat stertorously, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, and presently <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_840"><![CDATA[Presently <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> woke, and I gave <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> illness. It struck me as curious that the moment <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> became conscious <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> pressed the garlic flowers close to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. It was certainly odd that whenever <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> put the flowers from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>; but that when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> waked <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_841"><![CDATA[At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> sleep on. When he saw <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: "Draw up the blind; I want light!" Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s, examined <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, "Mein Gott!" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_842"><![CDATA[The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_843"><![CDATA[For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_844"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> dies conscious or in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep. Wake <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>that poor boy</gdescriptor>, and let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> come and see the last; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> trusts us, and we have promised <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_845"><![CDATA[I went to the dining-room and waked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was dazed for a moment, but when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> thought <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was late, and expressed <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> fear. I assured <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was still asleep, but told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> covered <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> hands, and slid down on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> knees by the sofa, where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> remained, perhaps a minute, with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> head buried, praying, whilst <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> shoulders shook with grief. I took <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> by the hand and raised <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> up. "Come," I said, "my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_846"><![CDATA[When we came into <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> opened <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes, and seeing <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>, whispered softly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_847"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was stooping to kiss <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, when Van Helsing motioned <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> back. "No," he whispered, "not yet! Hold <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hand; it will comfort <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> more."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_848"><![CDATA[So <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> hand and knelt beside <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looked <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes. Then gradually <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes closed, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> sank to sleep. For a little bit <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breast heaved softly, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breath came and went like a tired child's.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_849"><![CDATA[And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> opened <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lips:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_850"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_851"><![CDATA["Not for your life!" he said; "not for your living soul and <getHisHers(dracula_template_char_33)>!" And he stood between them like a lion at bay.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_852"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was so taken aback that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_853"><![CDATA[I kept my eyes fixed on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> face; the sharp teeth champed together.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_854"><![CDATA[Very shortly after <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> opened <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes in all their softness, and putting out <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown one; drawing it to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> kissed it. "My true friend," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, "My true friend, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)>! Oh, guard <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>, and give me peace!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_855"><![CDATA["I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_857"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s arm, and drew <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> away.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_858"><![CDATA[And then <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_860"><![CDATA[I took <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> by the arm, and led <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> away to the drawing-room, where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> sat down, and covered <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_861"><![CDATA[I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, and his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> body. Death had given back part of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> beauty, for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_871"><![CDATA[The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death-chamber:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_872"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to attend on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. It's not too much to say that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> will do credit to our establishment!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_873"><![CDATA[I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives at hand; and as <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> had to be back the next day to attend at his father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>English </attribute>legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_874"><![CDATA["I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such as this."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_875"><![CDATA[As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s breast, and which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had torn in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_876"><![CDATA["When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast>, seal all her papers, and write him to-night.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_877"><![CDATA[I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast>'s <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitor</attribute> and had written to him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_880"><![CDATA["I did not look for any specific thing.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_883"><![CDATA[Before turning in we went to look at poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>. The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small <i>chapelle ardente</i>. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s loveliness had come back to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of "decay's effacing fingers," had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_884"><![CDATA[The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: "Remain till I return," and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_885"><![CDATA[I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_887"><![CDATA["Must we make an autopsy?" I asked.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_888"><![CDATA["Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> head and take out <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, that you loved <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help.

Then, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.

If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things. <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> kiss <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> love--though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was dying--and snatched <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> away by all my strength? Yes!

Yes! And did you not hear me swear promise to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, that so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> closed her eyes grateful? Yes!]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_892"><![CDATA["Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!" He paused a moment and went on solemnly: "Friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_893"><![CDATA[I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love.

He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s father's which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to <dracula_template_char_37 name>. When he had told us so much he went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_903"><![CDATA["Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>daughter </gdescriptor>either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment. Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>daughter </gdescriptor>the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> only survived <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mother by five minutes, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> property would, in case there were no will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been treated at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> decease as under intestacy. In which case <dracula_template_char_37 alias>Lord Godalming</alias>, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_904"><![CDATA[He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_905"><![CDATA[He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see <dracula_template_char_40 name>. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was expected at five o'clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in very truth, for now both mother and <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>daughter </gdescriptor>lay in it. The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as <dracula_template_char_40 name> was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> feelings to see all that was left of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> <i>fiance</i> quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> came such shocks to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> feelings as we could avoid were saved.]]></textblock>

With me <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> upstairs. I did so, and left <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> at the door of the room, as I felt <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> would like to be quite alone with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:--]]></textblock>

It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lovingly and long, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> turned aside.

It made us think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down <dracula_template_loc_17 name>. <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> was holding me by the arm, the way <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> used to in old days before I went to school.

I believe in my heart of hearts that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> suffered as much about <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s death as any of us; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> bore <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_39)> through it like a moral Viking. <dracula_template_char_39 descriptor>If America can go on breeding men like that,</descriptor> she will be a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes over to <dracula_template_geoloc_6 name> to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> which may take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, who, <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>poor fellow</gdescriptor>, was speaking of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> part in the operation where <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> blood had been transfused to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s veins; I could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was saying that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> felt since then as if they two had been really married and that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was <dracula_template_char_37 descriptor>his wife </descriptor>in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_955"><![CDATA["Ah, you don't comprehend, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>. Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no time of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>so sweet young girl</gdescriptor>; I give my blood for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> may have all. And yet I can laugh at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> very grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>that poor boy--that dear boy,</gdescriptor> so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> so. And yet when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> <dracula_template_char_37 gdescriptor>as to no other man</gdescriptor>--not even to you, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, 'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_972"><![CDATA[ The neighbourhood of <dracula_template_loc_18 name> is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as "The Kensington Horror," or "The Stabbing Woman," or "The Woman in Black." During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a "<dracula_template_char_33 alias>bloofer lady</alias>." It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a "<dracula_template_char_33 alias>bloofer lady</alias>" had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the "<dracula_template_char_33 alias>bloofer lady</alias>" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the "<dracula_template_char_33 alias>bloofer lady</alias>" should be the popular role at these <i>al fresco</i> performances. Our correspondent naively says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine themselves--to be.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_973"><![CDATA[There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very young, in and around <dracula_template_loc_18 name> Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_997"><![CDATA[<i>Later.</i>--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s Journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> again. I shall try to save <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>--terrible though it be and awful in its consequences--to know for certain that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> eyes and ears and brain did not deceive <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s friend and <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>'s, and if they brought him all the way from <dracula_template_geoloc_6 name> to look after <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>. I feel from having seen him that he <i>is</i> good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s friend on "The <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name> News" told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> that memory was everything in such work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview; I shall try to record it <i>verbatim</i>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_998"><![CDATA[It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage <i>a deux mains</i> and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced "Dr. Van Helsing."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_999"><![CDATA[I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He said to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1000"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_32 alias>Mrs. Harker</alias>, is it not?" I bowed assent.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1003"><![CDATA["Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of <dracula_template_char_33 name>." And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly:--]]></textblock>

I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1005"><![CDATA["I have read your letters to <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias>. Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> sometimes kept a diary--you need not look surprised, <dracula_template_char_31 alias>Madam Mina</alias>; it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you--and in that diary <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walking in which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> puts down that you saved <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1006"><![CDATA["I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1009"><![CDATA["Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour." I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1010"><![CDATA["May I read it?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1011"><![CDATA["If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1012"><![CDATA["Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 gdescriptor>you so clever woman</gdescriptor>!" he said. "I knew long that <dracula_template_char_30 namePrefix> <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> was a man of much thankfulness; but see, <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>his wife</descriptor> have all the good things. And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me? Alas! I know not the shorthand." By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1013"><![CDATA["Forgive me," I said: "I could not help it; but I had been thinking that it was of dear <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1014"><![CDATA[He took it and his eyes glistened. "You are so good," he said. "And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1015"><![CDATA["By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat." He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1016"><![CDATA["Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 alias>Madam Mina</alias>," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you <dracula_template_char_31 gdescriptor>so clever woman. Madam</gdescriptor>"--he said this very solemnly--"if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights; you are one of the lights.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1017"><![CDATA["But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1018"><![CDATA["Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him!

I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> of your marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, <dracula_template_char_31 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, <dracula_template_char_31 gdescriptor>good women</gdescriptor> tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels' eyes. <dracula_template_char_31 descriptor>Your husband </descriptor>is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature.

Is all that fever gone, and is <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> strong and hearty?" I saw here an opening to ask him about <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, so I said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1021"><![CDATA["I suppose this upset <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, for when we were in town on Thursday last <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> had a sort of shock."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1023"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> thought <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> brain fever." And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, the horror which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> experienced, the whole fearful mystery of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>make my husband well</descriptor> again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1024"><![CDATA["My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by my friend <dracula_template_char_38 name> I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>good women still left to make life happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson</gdescriptor> for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>if your husband suffer</descriptor>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> suffer within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do <i>all</i> for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> that I can--all to make <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> life strong and <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>manly</gdescriptor>, and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious. <dracula_template_char_30 descriptor>Husband </descriptor><dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> would not like to see you so pale; and what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> like not where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> love, is not to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> good. Therefore for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> sake you must eat and smile. You have told me all about <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name> to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of <dracula_template_char_30 descriptor>husband </descriptor><dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1025"><![CDATA[After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1026"><![CDATA["And now tell me all about <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>." When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> a <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>madman</gdescriptor>--that Journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1027"><![CDATA["Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>my husband</descriptor>. I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things." He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1028"><![CDATA["Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1029"><![CDATA["Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s. It is the copy of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> Journal when abroad, and all that happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me what you think."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1030"><![CDATA["I promise," he said as I gave him the papers; "I shall in the morning, so soon as I can, come to see you and <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>your husband</descriptor>, if I may."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1031"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at <dracula_template_loc_19 name> before eight." He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name>, so that I may help <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> in case <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> is in a hurry.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1057"><![CDATA["And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help? I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here. Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1064"><![CDATA[I had got him the morning papers and the <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> papers of the previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette"--I knew it by the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently, groaning to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!" I do not think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand, calling out: "Love to <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>; I shall write so soon as ever I can."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1066"><![CDATA[<i>26 September.</i>--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> had become, to all intents, as sane as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> ever was. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was already well ahead with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> fly business; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had just started in the spider line also; so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had not been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> is bearing up wonderfully well. <dracula_template_char_39 name> is with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>, and that is much of a help, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_39)> is a bubbling well of good spirits. <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> wrote me a line too, and from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> I hear that <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> is beginning to recover something of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name> yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock, and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1067"><![CDATA["What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1068"><![CDATA[I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at <dracula_template_loc_18 name>. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up. "Well?" he said.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1069"><![CDATA["It is like poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1070"><![CDATA["And what do you make of it?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1071"><![CDATA["Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> has injured them." I did not quite understand his answer:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1072"><![CDATA["That is true indirectly, but not directly."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1073"><![CDATA["How do you mean, Professor?" I asked. I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, had he looked more stern.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1074"><![CDATA["Tell me!" I said. "I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1075"><![CDATA["Do you mean to tell me, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, that you have no suspicion as to what poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> died of; not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1076"><![CDATA["Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1077"><![CDATA["And how the blood lost or waste?" I shook my head. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1078"><![CDATA["You are <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>clever man</gdescriptor>, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism----"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1079"><![CDATA["Yes," I said. "Charcot has proved that pretty well." He smiled as he went on: "Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient that he influence. No? Then, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, with four men's blood in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> poor veins, could not live even one day? For, had <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> live one more day, we could have save <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias> was?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1080"><![CDATA["Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up. "Do you mean to tell me that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> in the nineteenth century?" He waved his hand for silence, and went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1081"><![CDATA["Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint? Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?" Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at <dracula_template_geoloc_1 name>; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1082"><![CDATA["Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in my mind from point to point <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>as a mad man</gdescriptor>, and not a sane one, follows an idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1083"><![CDATA["That is good image," he said. "Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is this: I want you to believe."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1084"><![CDATA["To believe what?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1085"><![CDATA["To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man. He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1086"><![CDATA["Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read your lesson aright?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1087"><![CDATA["Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's throats were made by the same that made the hole in <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias>?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1088"><![CDATA["I suppose so." He stood up and said solemnly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1089"><![CDATA["Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse, far, far worse."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1090"><![CDATA["In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1091"><![CDATA[He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1095"><![CDATA[ For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> life struck <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1096"><![CDATA["Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he said. "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1097"><![CDATA["Forgive me," said I. He went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1098"><![CDATA["My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>that so sweet lady</gdescriptor>. But even yet I do not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias>. To-night I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1099"><![CDATA[This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1100"><![CDATA[    "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1101"><![CDATA[He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1102"><![CDATA["The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at <dracula_template_geoloc_1 name>. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then----"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1103"><![CDATA["And then?" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>." My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing....]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1104"><![CDATA[We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. "Out of so many harmless ones," he said, "there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zoological Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this '<dracula_template_char_33 alias>bloofer lady</alias>' scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the '<dracula_template_char_33 alias>bloofer lady</alias>.'"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1105"><![CDATA["I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1106"><![CDATA["Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1107"><![CDATA[Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1108"><![CDATA["There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1109"><![CDATA[We dined at "Jack Straw's Castle" along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found the <dracula_template_char_33 nameLast> tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was not the only thing which could pass away.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1110"><![CDATA[Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1111"><![CDATA["What are you going to do?" I asked.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1112"><![CDATA["To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: "You shall see," and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1113"><![CDATA[I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1114"><![CDATA[It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. "Are you satisfied now, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>?" he asked.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1115"><![CDATA[I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1116"><![CDATA["I am satisfied that <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1117"><![CDATA["And what is that, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1118"><![CDATA["That it is not there."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1119"><![CDATA["That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But how do you--how can you--account for it not being there?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1120"><![CDATA["Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the undertaker's people may have stolen it." I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. "Ah well!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1121"><![CDATA[He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: "Will you keep it? You had better be assured." I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. "A key is nothing," I said; "there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1122"><![CDATA[It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1123"><![CDATA[Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1124"><![CDATA["Are you satisfied now?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1125"><![CDATA["No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1126"><![CDATA["Do you not see the child?"]]></textblock>

If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of <dracula_template_loc_18 name> Heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a cab near the "Spaniards," and drove to town.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1135"><![CDATA[<i>27 September.</i>--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1136"><![CDATA[There lay <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, seemingly just as we had seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> the night before <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> funeral. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1137"><![CDATA["Is this a juggle?" I said to him.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1138"><![CDATA["Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1139"><![CDATA["See," he went on, "see, they are even sharper than before. With this and this"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it--"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>?" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I <i>could</i> not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1140"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> may have been placed here since last night."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1141"><![CDATA["Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1142"><![CDATA["I do not know. Some one has done it."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1143"><![CDATA["And yet <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not look so." I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph. He was looking intently at the face of <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>the dead woman</gdescriptor>, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1144"><![CDATA["Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was bitten by the vampire when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know that, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> best come to take more blood. In trance <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> died, and in trance <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is Un-Dead, too. So it is that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> differ from all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was "home"--"their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> not Un-Dead <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep." This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's theories; but if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1145"><![CDATA["Ah, you believe now?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1146"><![CDATA[I answered: "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to accept. How will you do this bloody work?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1147"><![CDATA["I shall cut off <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> head and fill <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> body." It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>body of the woman </gdescriptor>whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1148"><![CDATA[I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1149"><![CDATA["I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> for ever. But then we may have to want <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, and how shall we tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> of this? If you, who saw the wounds on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>with a woman</gdescriptor> who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> die--if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, who know none of those things, to believe? <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> doubted me when I took <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> kiss when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was dying. I know <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> say good-bye as he ought; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> may think that in some more mistaken idea <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>this woman</gdescriptor> was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> by our ideas; and so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> will be much unhappy always. Yet <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> will sometimes think that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> loved was buried alive, and that will paint <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> dreams with horrors of what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> must have suffered; and again, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> will think that we may be right, and that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> once, and since then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)>, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>; then we can act for good all round and send <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the <dracula_template_loc_23 name> at ten of the clock. I shall send for <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> to come too, and also that <dracula_template_char_39 descriptor>so fine young man of America </descriptor>that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as <dracula_template_loc_17 name> and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."]]></textblock>

Therefore I shall fix some things <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> like not--garlic and a crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> is young as Un-Dead, and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> coming out; they may not prevail on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it.

Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way.

And then, to follow of <dracula_template_char_37 descriptor>your Lordship's wishes</descriptor> I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will."

In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, and then to help a <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>sweet young lady</gdescriptor>, whom, too, I came to love. For <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>--I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lover, but only <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> physician and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> friend.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1201"><![CDATA[ It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> bore <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_37)> well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1202"><![CDATA["You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias> in that coffin?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1203"><![CDATA["It was." The Professor turned to the rest saying:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1204"><![CDATA["You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me." He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> stepped forward. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> remained of a ghastly whiteness; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1205"><![CDATA[The coffin was empty!]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1206"><![CDATA[For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by <dracula_template_char_39 name>:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1207"><![CDATA["Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this your doing?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1208"><![CDATA["I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameLast> and I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> lay there. Did <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> not, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1209"><![CDATA["Yes."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1210"><![CDATA["That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--"now to the outside." He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1211"><![CDATA[Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. <dracula_template_char_39 name> was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> has to stake. Not being able to smoke, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1212"><![CDATA["I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1213"><![CDATA["And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?" asked <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst>. "Great Scott! Is this a game?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1214"><![CDATA["It is."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1215"><![CDATA["What is that which you are using?" This time the question was by <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1216"><![CDATA["The Host. I brought it from <dracula_template_geoloc_1 name>. I have an Indulgence." It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1217"><![CDATA[There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>a dark-haired woman</gdescriptor>, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, as we recognised the features of <dracula_template_char_33 name>. <dracula_template_char_33 name>, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> chin and stained the purity of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> lawn death-robe.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1218"><![CDATA[We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> up, he would have fallen.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1219"><![CDATA[When <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>--I call the thing that was before us <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> because it bore <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> shape--saw us <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes ranged over us. <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s eyes in form and colour; but <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> looked, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> had clutched strenuously to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>; when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> advanced to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> with outstretched arms and a wanton smile <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> fell back and hid <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> hands.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1220"><![CDATA[<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1221"><![CDATA["Come to me, <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, <dracula_template_char_37 descriptor>my husband</descriptor>, come!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1222"><![CDATA[There was something diabolically sweet in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> tones--something of the tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> seemed under a spell; moving <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> hands from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> opened wide <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> arms. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1223"><![CDATA[When within a foot or two of the door, however, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> turned, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could kill--we saw it at that moment.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1224"><![CDATA[And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1225"><![CDATA["Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1226"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> threw <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_37)> on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> knees, and hid <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> hands, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> answered:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1227"><![CDATA["Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;" and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> groaned in spirit. <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> and I simultaneously moved towards <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)>, and took <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>the woman</gdescriptor>, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1228"><![CDATA[When this was done, he lifted the child and said:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1229"><![CDATA["Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night; and then to home." Coming close to <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, he said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1230"><![CDATA["My friend <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary.

Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1231"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1233"><![CDATA[<i>29 September, night.</i>--A little before twelve o'clock we three--<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, <dracula_template_char_39 name>, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course, <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> wore black, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1234"><![CDATA[When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s coffin we all looked--<dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s shape without <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> soul. I could see even <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>'s face grow hard as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> looked. Presently <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> said to Van Helsing:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1235"><![CDATA["Is this really <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s body, or only a demon in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> shape?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1236"><![CDATA["It is <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> as she was, and is."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1237"><![CDATA[<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> seemed like a nightmare of <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1238"><![CDATA[When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1239"><![CDATA["Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor <dracula_template_char_37 shortName> die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become <i>nosferatu</i>, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>dear lady</gdescriptor> is but just begun. Those children whose blood <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> power over them they come to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>; and so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> draw their blood with that so wicked mouth. But if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the <dracula_template_char_33 gdescriptor>poor lady</gdescriptor> whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> shall take <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> that loved <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> best; the hand that of all <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> would <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_33)> have chosen, had it been to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> to choose?' Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1240"><![CDATA[We all looked at <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that <getHisHers(dracula_template_char_37)> should be the hand which would restore <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> stepped forward and said bravely, though <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> hand trembled, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face was as pale as snow:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1246"><![CDATA[The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> never faltered. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> looked like a figure of Thor as <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1247"><![CDATA[And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over.]]></textblock>

For a few minutes we were so taken up with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_37)> that we did not look towards the coffin.

Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1266"><![CDATA[When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of a diary kept by <dracula_template_char_30 name> when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Mrs. Harker</alias>'s diary at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>. "Take these," he said, "and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1270"><![CDATA[The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> own.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1287"><![CDATA["You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary."

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1291"><![CDATA["You do not know me," I said.

It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s experience in Transylvania I could not have believed.

Let us be able to tell him when they come." <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> went about <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> work of going his round of the patients; when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> had finished <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked.

Before I left him I remembered what <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> put in his diary of the Professor's perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at <dracula_template_geoloc_4 name>; so, seeing that <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of "The Westminster Gazette" and "The Pall Mall Gazette," and took them to my room. I remember how much "The Dailygraph" and "The <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> Gazette," of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> when <dracula_template_char_29 formalName> landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light.

At the moment <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> seemed as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> on a lot of subjects, all of which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> treated naturally. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> has never mentioned to my knowledge during <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> sojourn here. In fact, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> spoke quite confidently of getting <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> discharge at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast> and read the letters and the dates of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> after a brief time of observation.

Can it be that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1313"><![CDATA[<i>29 September, in train to <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>.</i>--When I received Mr. Billington's courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name> and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s to its place in <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>. Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had "taken no chances," and the absolute accuracy with which <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: "Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes." Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description "Fifty cases of common earth." I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were "main and mortal heavy," and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>wasn't any gentleman "such-like as yourself, squire,"</gdescriptor> to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1315"><![CDATA[<i>30 September.</i>--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at <dracula_template_loc_25 name>, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an <i>ex post facto</i> manner.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1316"><![CDATA[From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their <dracula_template_loc_25 name> office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at <dracula_template_loc_11 name>. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--]]></textblock>

It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>'s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite "blowing my trumpet," as <dracula_template_char_39 formalName> expressed it. <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>Poor fellows,</gdescriptor> neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>.

When we had finished, <dracula_template_char_32 formalName> said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1345"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," I answered. "Oh, very well," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said; "let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place." <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> method of tidying was peculiar: <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1358"><![CDATA["Why, I myself am an instance of a <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>man</gdescriptor> who had a strange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> life through the medium of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true, doctor?"

Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told <dracula_template_char_32 formalName> that it was time to leave. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> came at once, after saying pleasantly to <dracula_template_char_36 formalName>: "Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself," to which, to my astonishment, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> replied:--]]></textblock>

I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence: that the house which <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. "Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we might have reached <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> in time to save poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>. However, 'the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end."

He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> sat next to me. Opposite us were <dracula_template_char_40 name>, <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>, and <dracula_template_char_39 formalName>--<dracula_template_char_40 name> being next the Professor, and :--<dracula_template_char_38 formalName> in the centre.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1376"><![CDATA["There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'see! see! I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay, had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)>. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The <i>nosferatu</i> do not die like the bee when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> sting once. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil.

How then are we to begin our strike to destroy <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>? How shall we find <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>--without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are young.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1382"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_38 formalName> simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took his right hand, and <dracula_template_char_40 name> his left; <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> held my right with his left and stretched across to <dracula_template_char_39 formalName>. So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1383"><![CDATA["Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally. In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1384"><![CDATA["Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1385"><![CDATA["All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> limitations and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)>, and the peoples fear <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> at this day. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can flourish when that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can even grow younger; that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> special pabulum is plenty. But <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> cannot flourish without this diet; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> eat not as others. Even friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, who lived with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> for weeks, did never see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to eat, never! <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> throws no shadow; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> make in the mirror no reflect, as again <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> observe. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has the strength of many of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand--witness again <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> shut the door against the wolfs, and when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> help <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> from the diligence too. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can transform <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> tear open the dog; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can be as bat, as <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> saw him on the window at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>, and as friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst> saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> saw him at the window of <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can come in mist which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> create--that noble ship's captain proved <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> of this; but, from what we know, the distance <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> saw those sisters in the castle of <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> become so small--we ourselves saw <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias>, ere <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can, when once <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> find <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire--solder you call it. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can see in the dark--no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can do all these things, yet <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is not free. Nay; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> cannot go where he lists; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature's laws--why we know not. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to come; though afterwards <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can come as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> please. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> have limited freedom. If <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> be not at the place whither he is bound, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can do as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will within <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> limit, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> have <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> earth-home, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> coffin-home, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went to the grave of the suicide at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>; still at other time <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is nothing, but in their presence <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> coffin keep <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1386"><![CDATA["Thus when we find the habitation of this <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>-that-was, we can confine <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> coffin and destroy <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, if we obey what we know. But <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> who won <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> no common <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>; for in that time, and for centuries after, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>bravest of the sons </gdescriptor>of the 'land beyond the forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>s were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and 'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> is spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1408"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_40 name>, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night. <dracula_template_char_39 formalName>, you should be proud of your great state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes.

Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class. You, <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>gentlemen</gdescriptor>, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that you, <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances."

I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making a general statement that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> appeared to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> wishes.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1418"><![CDATA[As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> held up <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> two hands imploringly, and made <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> petition in a moving manner. As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> saw that the very excess of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> emotion was militating against <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, by restoring us more to our old relations, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had to make some request of which at the time <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had thought much, such, for instance, as when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> found that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> appeal would not be successful, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> got into quite a frantic condition. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> threw <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_36)> on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> knees, and held up <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> cheeks, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1427"><![CDATA[ <i>1 October, 5 a. m.</i>--I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> so absolutely strong and well. I am so glad that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> consented to hold back and let us <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>men</gdescriptor> do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to me that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was in this fearful business at all; but now that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> work is done, and that it is due to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> may well feel that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> part is finished, and that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with <dracula_template_char_36 name>. When we came away from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then <dracula_template_char_39 formalName> said to <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1428"><![CDATA["Say, <dracula_template_char_38 shortName>, if that <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>man</gdescriptor> wasn't attempting a bluff, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had some serious purpose, and if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had, it was pretty rough on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> not to get a chance." <dracula_template_char_40 name> and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1429"><![CDATA["Friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> would say. All is best as they are." <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1430"><![CDATA["I don't know but that I agree with you. <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>If that man </gdescriptor>had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> seems so mixed up with the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> fads. I can't forget how <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> teeth. Besides, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> called the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> 'lord and master,' and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> may want to get out to help <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own kind to help <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, so I suppose <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>man</gdescriptor>." The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1431"><![CDATA["Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?" <dracula_template_char_40 name> had slipped away for a few minutes, but now <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> returned. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> held up a little silver whistle, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> remarked:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1432"><![CDATA["That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on call." Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1433"><![CDATA["My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--<getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, can at certain times hold <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>; but they cannot hurt <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> as we can be hurt by <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> touch. Keep this near your heart"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--"put these flowers round your neck"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms--"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly equipped. "Now," he said, "friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, where are the skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at <dracula_template_char_33 alias>Miss Lucy</alias>'s."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1434"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_38 formalName> tried one or two skeleton keys, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_38)> mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> in good stead. Presently <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>'s diary of the opening of <dracula_template_char_33 formalName>'s tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1435"><![CDATA[<i>In manus tuas, Domine!</i>" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1436"><![CDATA[The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1437"><![CDATA[The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1438"><![CDATA["You know this place, <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>. You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?" I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. "This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered. None of the others had met the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> at all at close quarters, and when I had seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was either in the fasting stage of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> existence in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> rooms or, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1439"><![CDATA[Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1440"><![CDATA[We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1441"><![CDATA["The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest." A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1442"><![CDATA[There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright, for, seeing <dracula_template_char_40 name> suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for, as <dracula_template_char_40 name> said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows," and resumed <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for <i><getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)></i>. I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1443"><![CDATA[A few minutes later I saw <dracula_template_char_39 nameLast> step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining. We all followed <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1444"><![CDATA[For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save <dracula_template_char_40 name>, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> little silver whistle from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> pocket, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> blew a low, shrill call. It was answered from behind <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>'s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1445"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_40 name> lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1446"><![CDATA[With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1447"><![CDATA[The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front. Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1448"><![CDATA["So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful. No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> or troubling <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue <i>a particulari</i>: that the brute beasts which are to the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s command are yet themselves not amenable to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> call, just as from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> castle top <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother's cry, though they come to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst>. We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has not used <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."]]></textblock>

Indeed, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was so sound asleep that for a few seconds <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> complained a little of being tired, and I let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> rest till later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas Snelling to-day.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1454"><![CDATA[<i>1 October.</i>--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1455"><![CDATA["Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "I want <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> to talk of <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_36)> and of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> delusion as to consuming live things. He said to <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1456"><![CDATA["Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid my hand on the type-written matter. "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> <i>used</i> to consume life, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had eaten just before <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Mrs. Harker</alias> entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said. "Your memory is true, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>this madman </gdescriptor>than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he stood at the door.]]></textblock>

I spoke to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> made no reply whatever. "Don't you know me?" I asked. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> answer was not reassuring: "I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!" Not a word more would <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> say, but sat in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>. Friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, it does rejoice me unspeakable that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1461"><![CDATA["I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter.

This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> was late too, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> was the earlier. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> spoke to me before <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s house.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1466"><![CDATA[Last night I went to bed when the <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>men had gone</gdescriptor>, simply because they told me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> came to see me in <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>, perhaps poor dear <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> would be with us now. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> hadn't come there in the day-time with me <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> wouldn't have walked there in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> sleep; and if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_33)> hadn't gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_33)> as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did. Oh, why did I ever go to <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>? There now, crying again! I wonder what has come over me to-day. I must hide it from <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my own account, and whom <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> has never caused to shed a tear--<dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>the dear fellow </gdescriptor>would fret <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> heart out.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1467"><![CDATA[I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from <dracula_template_char_36 formalName>'s room, which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>The poor man </gdescriptor>was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said, I could in some way recognise in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> tones some passionate entreaty on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1468"><![CDATA[I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> to come back. I was very anxious about <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> told me of in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> had seen those awful women growing into reality though the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1470"><![CDATA[<i>2 October 10 p. m.</i>--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> coming to bed; but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing. In the afternoon <dracula_template_char_36 formalName> asked if he might see me. <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>Poor man</gdescriptor>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was very gentle, and when I came away <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> kissed my hand and bade God bless me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> would be miserable if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> knew I had been crying. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> and the others were out till dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1473"><![CDATA[ <i>1 October, evening.</i>--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at <dracula_template_loc_14 name>, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off I drove to <dracula_template_loc_13 alias>Walworth</alias>, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from <dracula_template_loc_11 name> and left at 197, Chicksand Street, <dracula_template_loc_27 name>, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, <dracula_template_loc_28 name>. If then the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> over <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could not mean to confine <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> to two sides of <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> in the south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from <dracula_template_loc_11 name>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1474"><![CDATA[He replied:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1475"><![CDATA["Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"--I had given him half a sovereign--"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1476"><![CDATA["Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch 'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1477"><![CDATA[This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes look as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> had been crying.

But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> being kept out of this dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> under any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_32)> has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> or <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> doings ever since we told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> of our decision.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1479"><![CDATA[<i>2 October, evening.</i>--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1481"><![CDATA[I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> going back to <dracula_template_geoloc_5 name>. I think <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> would be happier in our own home, with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> daily tasks to interest <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> for a moment, and told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_38)> where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I drove to <dracula_template_loc_13 alias>Walworth</alias> and found, with some difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook his head, and said: "I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never 'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind livin' ere or anywheres." I took out Smollet's letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. "What are you?" I asked.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1482"><![CDATA["I'm the depity," he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us"; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new "cold storage" building; and as this suited the condition of a "new-fangled ware'us," I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between <dracula_template_loc_11 name> and a house in <dracula_template_loc_17 name>, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--"main heavy ones"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in <dracula_template_loc_17 name>, to which he replied:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1483"><![CDATA["Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1493"><![CDATA["Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made one more attempt to further matters:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1494"><![CDATA["You didn't have any key?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1495"><![CDATA["Never used no key nor nothink. <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>The old gent</gdescriptor>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>opened the door 'isself </gdescriptor>an' shut it again when I druv off.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1496"><![CDATA["And you can't remember the number of the house?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1497"><![CDATA["No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper. <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>The old gent </gdescriptor>give them shillin's, an' they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>but 'e took one of them by the shoulder </gdescriptor>and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for <dracula_template_loc_17 name>. I had gained a new painful experience; the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>. If so, time was precious; for, now that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had achieved a certain amount of distribution, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could, by choosing <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own time, complete the task unobserved. At <dracula_template_loc_29 name> I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>. The house looked as though it had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of <dracula_template_loc_11 name>, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1498"><![CDATA[There was at present nothing to be learned from the <dracula_template_loc_17 name> side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the <dracula_template_loc_17 name> houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of "For Sale" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the <dracula_template_loc_23 alias>Berkeley</alias>, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1499"><![CDATA[The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the <dracula_template_loc_17 name> house--which throughout our interview he called a "mansion"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1500"><![CDATA["It is sold, <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>sir</gdescriptor>."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1501"><![CDATA["Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1502"><![CDATA[Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. "It is sold, <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>sir</gdescriptor>," was again his laconic reply.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1503"><![CDATA["Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1504"><![CDATA["But I do mind," he answered. "The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy." This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1505"><![CDATA["Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am myself <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>a professional man.</gdescriptor>" Here I handed him my card. "In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of <dracula_template_char_40 name>, who wishes to know something of the property which was, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> understood, lately for sale." These words put a different complexion on affairs. He said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1507"><![CDATA[I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>'s and came away.

Thank God, this will be the last night of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> out of our grim task. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> seems somehow more reconciled; or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, for when any accidental allusion is made <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> actually shudders.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1509"><![CDATA[I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone; so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves--I took <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> room and left <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> to go to bed. <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>The dear girl </gdescriptor>was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I came away.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1510"><![CDATA[When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1511"><![CDATA["This has been a great day's work, friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>. Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes.

Then shall we make our final <i>coup</i>, and hunt the wretch to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once <dracula_template_char_39 name> spoke:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1512"><![CDATA["Say! how are we going to get into that house?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1513"><![CDATA["We got into the other," answered <dracula_template_char_40 name> quickly.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1514"><![CDATA["But, <dracula_template_char_37 shortName>, this is different. We broke house at <dracula_template_loc_11 name>, but we had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in <dracula_template_loc_17 name>, either by day or night. I confess I don't see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning." <dracula_template_char_40 name>'s brows contracted, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> stood up and walked about the room. By-and-by <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1516"><![CDATA[As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least advisable to wait till <dracula_template_char_40 name> should hear from Mitchell's, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1519"><![CDATA[<i>1 October.</i>--I am puzzled afresh about <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast>. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> own well-being, they form a more than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> after <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> repulse of Van Helsing, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> manner was that of a man commanding destiny. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> did not really care for any of the things of mere earth; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1520"><![CDATA["What about the flies these times?" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> answered me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1521"><![CDATA["The fly, <dracula_template_char_38 gdescriptor>my dear sir</gdescriptor>, has one striking feature; its wings are typical of the aerial powers of the psychic faculties.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1522"><![CDATA[I thought I would push <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1523"><![CDATA["Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?" <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> madness foiled <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> reason, and a puzzled look spread over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face as, shaking <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1524"><![CDATA["Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want." Here <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> brightened up; "I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study zoophagy!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1525"><![CDATA[This puzzled me a little, so I drew <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1526"><![CDATA["Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1527"><![CDATA["Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually!" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1528"><![CDATA["And why with Enoch?"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1529"><![CDATA["Because he walked with God." I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it; so I harked back to what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had denied:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1530"><![CDATA["So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?" I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. The effort succeeded; for an instant <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> unconsciously relapsed into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> replied:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1531"><![CDATA["I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them or----" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. "And doctor, as to life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good friends--like you, <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>"; this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning. "I know that I shall never lack the means of life!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1532"><![CDATA[I think that through the cloudiness of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> insanity <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> saw some antagonism in me, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> at once fell back on the last refuge of such as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)>--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was sulky, and so I came away.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1533"><![CDATA[Later in the day <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time. <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast> is out, following up clues; and so are <dracula_template_char_40 name> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst>. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast>s; he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again. There was also another reason: <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> might not speak so freely before a third person as when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> and I were alone.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1534"><![CDATA[I found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> sitting out in the middle of the floor on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> part. When I came in, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said at once, as though the question had been waiting on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> lips:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1535"><![CDATA["What about souls?" It was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. "What about them yourself?" I asked. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> did not reply for a moment but looked all round <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, and up and down, as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> expected to find some inspiration for an answer.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1536"><![CDATA["I don't want any souls!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said in a feeble, apologetic way.

There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child, though the features were worn<dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>, and the stubble on the jaws was white</gdescriptor>. It was evident that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_36)>, I thought I would enter into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> mind as well as I could and go with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, speaking pretty loud so that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would hear me through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> closed ears:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1542"><![CDATA["Not much! flies are poor things, after all!" After a pause <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> added, "But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same."]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1583"><![CDATA[When I came to <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast>'s room I found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> lying on the floor on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>, it became at once apparent that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> over:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1584"><![CDATA["I think, sir, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> back is broken. See, both <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> right arm and leg and the whole side of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face are paralysed." How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1585"><![CDATA["I can't understand the two things. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> could mark <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face like that by beating <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> might have broke <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> neck by falling out of bed, if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things occurred. If <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> back was broke, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> couldn't beat <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> head; and if <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it." I said to him:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1586"><![CDATA["Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant's delay." The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> on the ground, he looked keenly at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1587"><![CDATA["Ah, a sad accident! <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> will need very careful watching, and much attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1588"><![CDATA[The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1589"><![CDATA["Send the attendant away. We must be alone with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> becomes conscious, after the operation." So I said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1590"><![CDATA["I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1591"><![CDATA[The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1592"><![CDATA["We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late." As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1593"><![CDATA["I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> or rather called for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?" I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it again. When <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1594"><![CDATA["My God! what has happened to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>? Poor, poor devil!" I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> briefly, and added that we expected <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would recover consciousness after the operation--for a short time, at all events. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> beside <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)>; we all watched in patience.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1595"><![CDATA["We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot; for it is evident that the hemorrhage is increasing."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1596"><![CDATA[The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words that <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> might speak. I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch. <dracula_template_char_36 gdescriptor>The poor man's breathing</gdescriptor> came in uncertain gasps. Each instant <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> seemed as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would open <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1597"><![CDATA[At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1598"><![CDATA["There is no time to lose. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> words may be worth many lives; I have been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1599"><![CDATA[Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> chest. Suddenly <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> moved convulsively, and as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> did so, said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1600"><![CDATA["I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully." <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> tried to turn his head; but even with the effort <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1601"><![CDATA["Tell us your dream, <dracula_template_char_36 formalName>." As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> heard the voice <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face brightened, through its mutilation, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1602"><![CDATA["That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed"--he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst>--"The brandy--it is in my study--quick!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was quite conscious, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1603"><![CDATA["I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality." Then <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1604"><![CDATA["If I were not sure already, I would know from them." For an instant <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> were bringing all <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> faculties to bear; when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> opened them <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> said, hurriedly, and with more energy than <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> had yet displayed:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1605"><![CDATA["Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes; and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was!" As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_36)> spoke, Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: "Go on," in a low voice. <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> proceeded:--]]></textblock>

I laughed at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, for I wanted to see what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> house. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> raised <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, only smaller. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> held up <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> hand, and they all stopped; and I thought <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were all gone, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour."]]></textblock>

I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. "So when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> came to-night I was ready for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight.

Ay, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> felt it too, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had to come out of the mist to struggle with me.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1624"><![CDATA[The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay <dracula_template_char_30 name>, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was <dracula_template_char_30 descriptor>the white-clad figure of his wife</descriptor>. By <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> side stood a tall, thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>, clad in black. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>--in every way, even to the scar on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> forehead. With <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> left hand <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> held both <dracula_template_char_32 formalName>'s hands, keeping them away with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> arms at full tension; <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> right hand gripped <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> by the back of the neck, forcing <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face down on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> bosom. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>'s bare breast which was shown by <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> turned <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> suddenly stopped, just as poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst>'s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, <dracula_template_char_37 shortName>, and I moved forward to <dracula_template_char_32 formalName>, who by this time had drawn <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> lay in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> helpless attitude and disarray. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> lips and cheeks and chin; from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> throat trickled a thin stream of blood; <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes were mad with terror. Then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> put before <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> body, whilst <dracula_template_char_37 shortName>, after looking at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room.

I expected to see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> in some shape go back to <dracula_template_loc_11 name>; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> evidently sought some other lair. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1642"><![CDATA["I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble." <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>husband</descriptor> involuntarily groaned as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> turned to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> and said lovingly: "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> coming in had not waked me, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, but found that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist had turned into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a tall, thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>, all in black. I knew <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> at once from the description of the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at <dracula_template_geoloc_11 name>. I knew, too, the red scar on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> forehead where <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> had struck <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed.

With a mocking smile, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> did so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!'

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1651"><![CDATA[ <i>3 October.</i>--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could not have landed <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However, we must trust and hope. Poor <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> told me just now, with the tears running down <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1652"><![CDATA[When Dr. Van Helsing and <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> had come back from seeing poor <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast>, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> lying on the floor, all in a heap. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_36)> face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1653"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_38 formalName> asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then <dracula_template_char_36 nameLast> had called out loudly several times, "God! God! God!" after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)> lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_36)>. Van Helsing asked if he had heard "voices" or "a voice," and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word "God" was spoken by the patient. <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> said to us, when we were alone, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_38)> did not wish to go into the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1654"><![CDATA[When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was that <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> should be in full confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be kept from <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_32)> agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. "There must be no concealment," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> said, "Alas! we have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!" Van Helsing was looking at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> fixedly as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1655"><![CDATA["But dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?" <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face grew set in its lines, but <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> answered:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1657"><![CDATA["To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> meant. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> answer came with direct simplicity, as though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> were simply stating a fact:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1660"><![CDATA["I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> looked at him meaningly as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> and put his hand on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> head as he said solemnly:]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1661"><![CDATA["My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my child----" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat; he gulped it down and went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1662"><![CDATA["There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past." The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all silent; we could do nothing. At length <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> grew more calm and turning to him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> held out <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> hand:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1663"><![CDATA["I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may have passed away from me." <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, and we began to discuss what we were to do. I told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> had done before. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if "pleased" could be used in connection with so grim an interest.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1664"><![CDATA[As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1665"><![CDATA["It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting after our visit to <dracula_template_loc_11 name> we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there. Had we done so, the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others; but now <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> does not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> lairs, so that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> cannot use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in <dracula_template_loc_17 name>, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> now has. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is confined within the limitations of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> earthly envelope. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> go through a doorway, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out all <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> and destroy <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, drive <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure." Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly. "Nay, friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>," he said, "in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in <dracula_template_loc_17 name>. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> may have many houses which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has bought. Of them <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will have paper that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> write on; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will have <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> book of cheques. There are many belongings that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet, where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> call, in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_37)> phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we run down our old fox--so? is it not?"]]></textblock>

Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done <i>en regle</i>; and in our work we shall be <i>en regle</i> too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1678"><![CDATA[I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1683"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_32 shortName> took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was very, very pale--almost ghastly, and so thin that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName> when the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> had sucked <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_33)> blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1684"><![CDATA[When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed that before starting for <dracula_template_loc_17 name> we should destroy the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s lair close at hand. In case <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> in our work of destruction; and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> presence in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> purely material shape, and at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> weakest, might give us some new clue.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1685"><![CDATA[As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to <dracula_template_loc_11 name>, we should all enter the house in <dracula_template_loc_17 name>; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst <dracula_template_char_40 name> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> found the lairs at <dracula_template_loc_13 alias>Walworth</alias> and <dracula_template_loc_27 alias>Mile End</alias> and destroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> might appear in <dracula_template_loc_17 name> during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> then and there. At any rate, we might be able to follow <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> would not listen to my objection. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s resolution was fixed; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> said that it was the last hope for <i><getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)></i> that we should all work together. "As for me," <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> said, "I have no fear. Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>my husband!</descriptor> God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present." So I started up crying out: "Then in God's name let us come at once, for we are losing time.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1689"><![CDATA[Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene! <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> struggled hard to keep <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> brave countenance; but the pain overmastered <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> put <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> hands before <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face, and shuddered whilst <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>. "Oh, <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>," he said, "dear, dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, alas! that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not?" He bent low beside <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> as he spoke; <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> took his hand, and looking at him through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> tears, said hoarsely:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1691"><![CDATA[Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> was the brightest and most cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1692"><![CDATA["Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?" We all assured him. "Then it is well.

But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> may not enter. Now let me guard yourself.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1693"><![CDATA[There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s forehead, it had seared it--had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor darling's brain had told <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> the significance of the fact as quickly as <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> sank on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> beautiful hair over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face, as the leper of old his mantle, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> wailed out:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1694"><![CDATA["Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day." They all paused. I had thrown myself beside <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1695"><![CDATA["It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1696"><![CDATA[There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>We men </gdescriptor>pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1697"><![CDATA[It was then time to start. So I said farewell to <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1698"><![CDATA[To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> must be a vampire in the end, then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1699"><![CDATA[We entered <dracula_template_loc_11 name> without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1700"><![CDATA["And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has chosen this earth because it has been holy. Thus we defeat <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own weapon, for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God." As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1708"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a <dracula_template_geoloc_3 attribute>solicitor</attribute> and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better." I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> went on: "Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had better go with <dracula_template_char_38 shortName> and the Professor and stay in the <dracula_template_loc_36 name>, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in."]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1709"><![CDATA["The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameLast> hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the <dracula_template_loc_36 name>. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1710"><![CDATA[At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got <dracula_template_char_40 name> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameLast>; and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. <dracula_template_char_39 nameLast> paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and <dracula_template_char_40 name> pointed out what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_37)> wanted done. The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark. <dracula_template_char_40 name> smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to <dracula_template_char_40 name>, who took out his purse and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1711"><![CDATA[When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door. It was immediately opened by <dracula_template_char_39 name>, beside whom stood <dracula_template_char_40 name> lighting a cigar.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1712"><![CDATA["The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we came in. It did indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at <dracula_template_loc_11 name>--and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> had been using the place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> might not be in the house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> effects.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1713"><![CDATA[After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the <dracula_template_loc_17 name> house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at <dracula_template_loc_27 alias>Mile End</alias> and <dracula_template_loc_28 name>; note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had examined this last find, <dracula_template_char_40 name> and <dracula_template_char_39 name> taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of the <dracula_template_char_39 namePrefix>.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1722"><![CDATA["Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally.

But these are not <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> most important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> was growing, and he began to consider whether <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might not himself move the box. So <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> began to help; and then, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> found that this be all-right, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> try to move them all alone. And so <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> progress, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> scatter these graves of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>; and none but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> know where they are hidden. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.

By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> are on their way to us.

It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_39 name>. They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1735"><![CDATA["<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will be here before long now," said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his pocket-book.  <i>Nota bene</i>, in <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>Madam</gdescriptor>'s telegram he went south from <dracula_template_loc_11 name>, that means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o'clock. That <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went south has a meaning for us. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is as yet only suspicious; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went from <dracula_template_loc_11 name> first to the place where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would suspect interference least. You must have been at <dracula_template_loc_28 name> only a short time before him. That <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is not here already shows that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went to <dracula_template_loc_27 alias>Mile End</alias> next. This took <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> some time; for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Be ready!" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1736"><![CDATA[I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, <dracula_template_char_39 name> had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and <dracula_template_char_37 nameFirst> and I had been accustomed to obey <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast>, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> behind and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> feared it.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1737"><![CDATA[Suddenly with a single bound <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. There was something so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> coming. The first to act was <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast>, who, with a quick movement, threw <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_30)> before the door leading into the room in the front of the house. As the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything. <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast> evidently meant to try the matter, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> had ready <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s leap back saved <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out. The expression of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast>, though I saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s face. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> swept under <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast>'s arm, ere <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the "ting" of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.]]></textblock>

There <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> turned and spoke to us:--]]></textblock>

I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>Your girls that you all love </gdescriptor>are mine already; and through them you and others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed. Bah!" With a contemptuous sneer, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> passed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> through the stable, we moved toward the hall.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1740"><![CDATA["We have learnt something--much!

For if not, why <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> hurry so? <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> very tone betray <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, if so that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> return." As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took the title-deeds in the bundle as <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast> had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1746"><![CDATA[We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told <dracula_template_char_32 formalName> everything which had passed; and although <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>husband</descriptor>, and red at others when <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> devotion to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> was manifested, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> listened bravely and with calmness.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1754"><![CDATA[<i>3-4 October, close to midnight.</i>--I thought yesterday would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> alone knew where it was. If <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> chooses to lie hidden, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> may baffle us for years; and in the meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know: that if ever there was a <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>woman</gdescriptor> who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I love <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> a thousand times more for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep; for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me until....]]></textblock>

When the Professor saw <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> a smile--a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he said:--]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1773"><![CDATA[Looking fixedly at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, he commenced to make passes in front of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, from over the top of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> head downward, with each hand in turn. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand.

The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> opened <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> did not seem <dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>the same woman</gdescriptor>. There was a far-away look in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in. They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> thoughts:--]]></textblock>

The room was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed just upon us.

So off we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.]]></textblock>

That <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> scatter <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> to the office and then to the ship, where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. The captain come, when told that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> go and some one tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> where horse and cart can be hired. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> go there and soon <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> come again, <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> driving cart on which a great box; this <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> give much talk to captain as to how and where <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> in many tongues, and tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> that if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> like <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can come and see where it shall be. But <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> say 'no'; that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> come not yet, for that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> make <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> bow, and thank him, and say that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might purchase ship forms, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> departed.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1812"><![CDATA["No one knew where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> box--old and with much bloom and blood--were in hell. But the thin <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must have come off by <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)>, for none notice <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. Indeed they thought not of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.]]></textblock>

To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> there. Our best hope is to come on <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can make no struggle, and we may deal with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)> as we should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs.

The very place, where <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_29)> were from the first some great qualities.

This must not be! We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1824"><![CDATA[It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on <dracula_template_char_32 formalName>'s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even <dracula_template_char_32 formalName> seems to lose sight of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> mind, that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> thinks of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor <dracula_template_char_32 formalName>'s tongue is tied. I <i>know</i> that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> forms conclusions of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> veins beginning to work. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> had <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own purposes when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> gave <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> what Van Helsing called "the Vampire's baptism of blood." Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor <dracula_template_char_32 formalName>'s silences, then there is a terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same power that compels <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> silence may compel <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> speech.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1830"><![CDATA["With the sad experience of <dracula_template_char_33 namePrefix> <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, we must this time be warned before things go too far.

I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> teeth are some sharper, and at times <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes are more hard.

He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured.

For my own part, I thought that if <dracula_template_char_32 formalName> realised the danger <getHimselfHerself(dracula_template_char_32)>, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again.

Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> can bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of <dracula_template_loc_37 descriptor>nearly two weeks</descriptor>. Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary.

The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> lips are curved and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> face beams with happiness.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1877"><![CDATA[I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see <dracula_template_char_32 formalName> a little before the time of sunset.

This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.]]></textblock>

I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God's will.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1904"><![CDATA[<i>15 October, Varna.</i>--We left <dracula_template_loc_33 name> on the morning of the 12th, <dracula_template_loc_33 descriptor>got to Paris the same night</descriptor>, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o'clock. <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--"the Odessus." The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world. Thank God! <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> is well, and looks to be getting stronger; <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> colour is coming back. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> thoughts obey him. He always asks <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> can see and hear. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> answers to the first:--]]></textblock>

The wind is high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam." It is evident that the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna. <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> has just returned. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> had arranged before leaving London that <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_40)> agent should send <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_40)> every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1907"><![CDATA[We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, even if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> own volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> dare not change to man's form without suspicion--which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> evidently wishes to avoid--<getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, as we did of poor <dracula_template_char_33 shortName>, before <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> wakes.

The owner gave <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_40)> a paper telling the Captain to give <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_40)> every facility in doing whatever <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_40)> agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast>'s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> is there, Van Helsing and <dracula_template_char_38 nameLast> will cut off <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> head at once and drive a stake through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> heart. <dracula_template_char_39 nameLast> and <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the <dracula_template_char_40 namePrefix>'s body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1918"><![CDATA[<i>25 October.</i>--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> got <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_40)> telegram from Lloyd's. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. <dracula_template_char_32 formalName>, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> did not; for we took special care not to let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> presence. In old days <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, and though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> seems strong and well, and is getting back some of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It would break poor <dracula_template_char_30 nameLast>'s heart--certainly <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> nerve--if <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> teeth very carefully, whilst <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate. "Euthanasia" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.]]></textblock>

True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.

That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more. <i>Dos pou sto</i>,' said Archimedes.

To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before!

Usually <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> answer came:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1965"><![CDATA["I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.

Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, in answer to <dracula_template_char_40 formalName>'s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1990"><![CDATA["Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It's no canny to run frae <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> to the Black Sea wi' a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his ain purpose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin' him." This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1991"><![CDATA["Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!" The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1992"><![CDATA["When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin' old <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias> just before we had started frae <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>. I had seen them speer at <dracula_template_char_29 gdescriptor>the fellow</gdescriptor>, and put out their twa fingers when they saw <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well, we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a handspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz <i>vi.</i> Varna, I thocht I'd let it lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi' an order, written to him from <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>, to receive a box marked for one <dracula_template_char_29 name>. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither than that same!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1993"><![CDATA["What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1994"><![CDATA["I'll be tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim." Burgen-strasse 16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we came away.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1995"><![CDATA[We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he knew.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1996"><![CDATA[We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable go find him. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1997"><![CDATA[Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out "This is the work of a Slovak!" We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1998"><![CDATA[As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_1999"><![CDATA[When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>.]]></textblock>

This is not what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> intends; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> does not mean to risk it.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2018"><![CDATA[3. <i>By Water.</i>--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another. On the water <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> is powerless except at night; even then <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> can only summon fog and storm and snow and <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> wolves. But were <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> wrecked, the living water would engulf <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>, helpless; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> would indeed be lost. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was not free to move, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> position would still be desperate.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2019"><![CDATA[We know from the record that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain <i>what</i> water.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2020"><![CDATA[The first thing is to realise exactly what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> later task is to be.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2022"><![CDATA[<i>Secondly.</i> we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> has done here.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2023"><![CDATA[As to the first, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> means of exit from <dracula_template_geoloc_3 name>; <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box <i>before sunrise</i>. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2024"><![CDATA[That, so far, <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> plans were successful we know. The <i>Czarina Catherine</i> made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2025"><![CDATA[Now we come to what the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> must have done after <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> arrival- <i>on land</i>, at Galatz.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2026"><![CDATA[The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> could appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In <dracula_template_char_30 descriptor>my husband's</descriptor> diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> wanted isolation.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2027"><![CDATA[My surmise is, this: that in <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name> the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> decided to get back to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for <dracula_template_geoloc_8 name>. Thus the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> came out from <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> thought, by murdering <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> agent.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2028"><![CDATA[I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> box, then, was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2029"><![CDATA[Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>'s castle as can be got by water.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2038"><![CDATA["Friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, this is to you for twice reasons.

Be not afraid for <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>; she will be my care, if I may. I am old.

And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> and friend <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> guard the bank where perchance <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> might be landed, I will take <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> right into the heart of the enemy's country.

And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used. I felt so thankful that <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> is rich, and that both <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> and <dracula_template_char_39 name>, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_39 name> have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2048"><![CDATA[<i>October 30. Night.</i>--I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> is firing up. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> is an experienced hand at the work, as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> has had for years a launch of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_40)> own on the <dracula_template_loc_37 name>, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>'s guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>'s escape back to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_29)> Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. <dracula_template_char_39 name> and <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for <dracula_template_char_32 shortName>, if required.]]></textblock>

We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time. <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> insists that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_40)> shall keep the first watch.

I am <dracula_template_char_30 gdescriptor>a new man</gdescriptor> this morning; and, as I sit here and watch <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_40)> sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me. I wonder where <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_39 name> are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix>, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2070"><![CDATA[ <i>1 November.</i>--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are <i>very, very</i> superstitious. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual "darkness, lapping water and creaking wood"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, but somehow I have now no fear for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed....

We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much.

I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, and so I am silent of it. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to hypnotise <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>; but alas! though <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> shut <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes obedient, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> too late, but so heavy that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> will not wake. I have to lift <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> up, and place <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam</alias> still sleep, and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> look in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2087"><![CDATA[All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival. <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>--even for food. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, tainted as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> is with that Vampire baptism. "Well," said I to myself, "if it be that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night." As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> tell of in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2088"><![CDATA[I woke <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, and again tried to hypnotise <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> rugs. I got ready food: but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> would not eat, simply saying that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> had not hunger. I did not press <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, knowing <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> comfort, round where <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> sat still all the time--so still as one dead; and <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> said. But when I drew near, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)> presently, when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> had grown more quiet:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2089"><![CDATA["Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a test of what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> could. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> rose obedient, but when <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> have made a step <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> stopped, and stood as one stricken.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2090"><![CDATA["Why not go on?" I asked. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> shook <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> head, and, coming back, sat down in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> said simply:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2091"><![CDATA["I cannot!" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be danger to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> body, yet her soul was safe!]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2092"><![CDATA[Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2093"><![CDATA["No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!" I turned to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, and looking in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> eyes, said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2094"><![CDATA["But you? It is for you that I fear!" whereat <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> laughed--a laugh, low and unreal, and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2095"><![CDATA["Fear for <i>me</i>! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> saw in the room, when they would have kissed <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2096"><![CDATA["<dracula_template_char_32 gdescriptor>Come, sister</gdescriptor>. Come to us. Come! Come!" In fear I turned to my poor <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the terror in <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> was not, yet, of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> whilst <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> remained within the ring, which <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2097"><![CDATA[And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2098"><![CDATA[Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, intending to hypnotise <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>; but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could not wake <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>. I tried to hypnotise through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> sleep, but <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_32)> made no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.]]></textblock>

They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2105"><![CDATA[<i>5 November, afternoon.</i>--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out. <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s bitter experience served me here. By memory of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2106"><![CDATA[<getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_32)>. Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2107"><![CDATA[I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2108"><![CDATA[There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> that I heard.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2109"><![CDATA[Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias> had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2113"><![CDATA[Oh, my friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud "I am here!"]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2119"><![CDATA[<i>6 November.</i>--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast>'s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2120"><![CDATA[In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the hand and drew me in: "See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one." He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2121"><![CDATA["Look! <dracula_template_char_32 alias>Madam Mina</alias>, look! look!" I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2122"><![CDATA[On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2123"><![CDATA["At least you shall be safe here from <i><getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)></i>!" He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us. "See," he said, "they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can." He paused and went on in a hollow voice:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2124"><![CDATA["They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be done!" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2125"><![CDATA["Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> and <dracula_template_char_38 nameFirst>. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots it all out!" I took it and looked. <dracula_template_char_38 descriptor>The two men </descriptor>might be <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_39 name>. I knew at all events that neither of them was <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>. At the same time I <i>knew</i> that <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> was not far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, and the other I took, of course, to be <dracula_template_char_40 formalName>. They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. "They are all converging," he said. "When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides." I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2126"><![CDATA[Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us; but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2127"><![CDATA[Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our presence.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2128"><![CDATA[All at once two voices shouted out to: "Halt!" One was my <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s, raised in a high key of passion; the other <dracula_template_char_39 name>' strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> dashed up at one side and <dracula_template_char_38 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_39 name> on the other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang forward; <dracula_template_char_39 descriptor>but the four men </descriptor>raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2129"><![CDATA[The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, <dracula_template_char_32 descriptor>all four men of our party </descriptor>threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2130"><![CDATA[In the midst of this I could see that <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> on one side of the ring of men, and <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst> on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)>; instinctively they cowered, aside and let <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_30)> pass. In an instant <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_30)> had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, <dracula_template_char_39 name> had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> I had, with the tail of my eye, seen <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> won a way through them, and they cut at <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> had parried with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> great bowie knife, and at first I thought that <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> too had come through in safety; but as <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> sprang beside <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> left hand <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> was clutching at <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> side, and that the blood was spurting through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> fingers. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> did not delay notwithstanding this, for as <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> great Kukri knife, <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> attacked the other frantically with <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> bowie. Under the <dracula_template_char_30 descriptor>efforts of both men </descriptor>the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2131"><![CDATA[By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of <dracula_template_char_40 formalName> and <dracula_template_char_38 formalName>, had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the <dracula_template_char_29 namePrefix> lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_29)>. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_29)> was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2132"><![CDATA[As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2133"><![CDATA[But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst>'s great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same moment <dracula_template_char_39 name>'s bowie knife plunged into the heart.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2134"><![CDATA[It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from our sight.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2135"><![CDATA[I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2136"><![CDATA[The Castle of <dracula_template_char_29 nameLast> now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2137"><![CDATA[The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead <dracula_template_char_29 alias>man</alias>, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2138"><![CDATA[<dracula_template_char_39 name>, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> elbow, holding <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> hand pressed to <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> side; the blood still gushed through <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors. <dracula_template_char_30 nameFirst> knelt behind <getHimHer(dracula_template_char_39)> and the wounded man laid back <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> head on <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_30)> shoulder. With a sigh <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> own which was unstained. <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> smiled at me and said:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2139"><![CDATA["I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!" <getHeShe(dracula_template_char_39)> cried suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, "It was worth for this to die! Look! look!"]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2140"><![CDATA[The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light.

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2141"><![CDATA["Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not more stainless than <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_32)> forehead! The curse has passed away!"]]></textblock>

<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2144"><![CDATA[ Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> and to me that our boy's birthday is the same day as that on which <dracula_template_char_39 name> died. <getHisHer(dracula_template_char_39)> mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but we call him <dracula_template_char_39 nameFirst>.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2145"><![CDATA[In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2146"><![CDATA[When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all look back on without despair, for <dracula_template_char_40 nameLast> and <dracula_template_char_38 nameLast> are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later note-books of <dracula_template_char_32 shortName> and <dracula_template_char_38 nameLast> and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee:--]]></textblock>
<textblock id="dracula_template_textblock_2147"><![CDATA["We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is.
